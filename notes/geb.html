        Douglas Hofstadter's award-winning book, Gödel, Escher, Bach, is a journey through surprisingly intertwined ideas
        from mathematics, art, music, computer science, and philosophy. Something about <a href="zettlekasten.html">Zettlekasten</a>.

    <h2>
        The shared experience of GEB Edit
    </h2>
    <p>
        Gödel, Escher, Bach has introduced new fields of thought to a generation of self-directed learners. A Nature review
        called it "an entire humanistic education between the covers of a single book". It's become a fixture in geek
        culture, even bleeding into popular culture once in a while.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's a book that encourages you to participate in it. To fully experience it, you don't just read it, you do it by
        doing the math, listening to the music, participating in the culture surrounding it, and discussing the ideas you
        come across with other people.
    </p>

    <p>
        As much as the book is packed full of ideas, the book alone doesn't give you everything you need to get the most out
        of it. Reading GEB has often been a solitary experience, with readers having to go look up the music, the cultural
        references, the details of the math, and the ways these fields of knowledge have changed in the decades since it was
        written.
    </p>

    <p>
        You could imagine a supplement to GEB that contains everything the book doesn't. A place to find "notes in the
        margin" written by other people sharing the experience of reading the book. That's what this wiki could be.
