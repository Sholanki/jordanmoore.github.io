        <title>Going Freelance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to announce that after 7 years working in web agencies I have decided to leave and start a new adventure as a freelance web designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I joined Front in 2008 midway through my final year of university, I have spent the last 7 years honing my craft specialising in &lt;strong&gt;responsive web design&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;user experience&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;front end&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Expression Engine development&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe that being part of the team with Front (now known as Typecast) and Eyekiller has equipped me with the skills required to manage my own destiny and seek new and exciting projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working and collaborating closely with clients of all different shapes and sizes from various sectors including the BBC, Firefly and TextHelp and has been a truly invaluable experience. I’ll miss working with my fantastic clients - it has been a priviledge working together with &lt;strong&gt;each and every one of you&lt;/strong&gt; to make useful, meaningful things for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course I will miss working alongside the wonderful team at Eyekiller. I have made many friends since I joined in 2012. My last day is just under a month away on April 1st 2015. If you have any projects you would like to discuss with me, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#098;&amp;#121;&amp;#106;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I am the Fold</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t usually keep my cards close my chest, but I was very excited about building a little web app to counter the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/&quot;&gt;recent, and in my opinion, misinformed&lt;/a&gt; talk of the importance of &amp;#8220;the fold&amp;#8221; in web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/_iest&quot;&gt;Iestyn Williams&lt;/a&gt; has made it happen at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iamthefold.com/&quot;&gt;iamthefold.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not going to get the opportunity to build this thing any time soon so please feel free to take the idea and run with it because I&amp;#8217;d love to see it come to life rather than sink into the abyss of my Someday list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A one page website that saves the height of the user&amp;#8217;s viewport on page load to a database, draws a line at this value (in the form of an HTML element — a 1px high div will do) and that&amp;#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool part is that it will show you the lines drawn by &lt;strong&gt;every user to have visited that page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:p110325451951-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:p110325451951-1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;ll prove in a nice visual way if there is such a thing as the common fold, let&amp;#8217;s leave it up to science!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Added fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ditch this part. I thought about a tongue in cheek Spartacus analogy calling the app &amp;#8220;I am the Fold&amp;#8221; with a searchable Twitter hashtag #iamthefold which would show a list of Tweets containing the user&amp;#8217;s screen height and a link to the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be an effective way of demoing to clients and others that there is no such thing as a common page fold. The array of Tweets with different pixel values and the page itself with lines sporadically drawn depicting different viewport heights through the power of random will hopefully make the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take it or leave it. I&amp;#8217;m certainly not going to get a chance to make it happen any time soon and I&amp;#8217;d feel bad letting the idea rot when it could be of some use to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn:p110325451951-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it becomes a performance concern I had considering capping this at the last 100 or 200 users. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:p110325451951-1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>A Modern Default</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are few things on the Web that excite me more than a new HTML document its raw form and the possibilities it brings. In an unstyled HTML document the contents are laid bare for all to see. Out-of-the-box HTML comes with an established typographic hierarchy and elements are distinguishable like the different variations of lists that we seem to have a strange habit of resetting and stripping of the characteristics that make it a list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default styles for HTML are sensible defaults. The type is legible, the layout is functional — in fact it&amp;#8217;s almost entirely responsive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jordanmoore/Modern-Default-HTML&quot;&gt;with a few small tweaks&lt;/a&gt; it &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; be completely responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jordanmoore/Modern-Default-HTML&quot;&gt;shared a project on GitHub called Modern Default HTML&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s nothing overly remarkable, nothing fancy and it didn&amp;#8217;t take very long to make. But I felt the need to publish it to show the few changes necessary to make the default web page accessible on all devices. There are a few similar projects out there, but perhaps this is a more focused effort at addressing the initial tweaks necessary for a completely accessible starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My project goals were simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay true to the default and do the minimum required to make the default web page work anywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t impose any solutions to common design problems (and there are plenty like responsive tables for example — the same solution may not apply to all types of data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a related note - there shouldn&amp;#8217;t be anything in the default you will need to undo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been meditating on the idea that as designers we owe it to ourselves and anyone who comes into contact with the things we make that we stay as true to the sensible defaults as we possibly can within the typical constraints of a web project. The default web page is fast, functional and founded upon a clear typographic hierarchy. Any design decisions we make thereafter will either enhance this experience or tarnish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m asking myself more challenging questions in this mindset when designing even the smallest change: &amp;#8220;Why is this better than the default?&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;What does this bring to the table?&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Is this feature so critical to the goals of this page that the performance hit is necessary?&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Does it break the default or is it loading a completely redundant asset?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As designers we are in the position of power where we can both make and break the Web. We have a great foundation to work with by default, it&amp;#8217;s up to us where we go with it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The web designer&#39;s holiday gift guide 2014</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the holiday season drawing ever closer, I thought I&amp;#8217;d revisit a theme from last year and pull together some Christmas gift ideas for folks in the web industry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky finding a suitable gift that will be of genuine use to the recipient — whether it&amp;#8217;s a co-worker, a relative or maybe you&amp;#8217;re looking for a meaningful gift that will benefit someone who works in the web or is looking to break into the industry. I&amp;#8217;ve tried to strike a good balance between the obvious, the eclectic, gifts for pros and gifts for beginners. Happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tilde by Jessica Hische (from $20 per year)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8608/15664299767_0a4331fb5f_c.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jessica&amp;#8217;s attention to detail is evident in those beautiful in-between details&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stunning new typeface that looks effortless but is full of gorgeous subtle flourishes in its ligatures and strokes. It comes in two sizes for small and large uses helping maintain its delicate quality wherever you use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://tilda.fontbureau.com&quot;&gt;Webtype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sketch 3 ($99)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 has been the year of Sketch. Most folks I know have ditched other graphics editors in favour of Bohemian Coding&amp;#8217;s contender. Sketch is great for easily exporting resolution independent assets, constructing styleguides, establishing typographic systems - you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infinite canvas approach helps keep your broad vision for your project in check — and the ability to create symbols will save you heaps of time if you need to adjust shared elements across a number of layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/&quot;&gt;Bohemian Coding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kano ($149)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7541/15662728718_e06c94a220_c.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Creativity out of the box — build the hardware, build the software — Kano is a great learning tool&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching Alex Klein speak at &lt;a href=&quot;http://breakconf.org&quot;&gt;Break Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Belfast earlier this month I was completely astounded by what his company achieved with the Kano project. It started life as a humble Raspberry Pi and became a set of easy-to-assemble components that slot together to make a computer that teaches you how to code. The best part is - it&amp;#8217;s great for kids and adults alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kano.me&quot;&gt;Kano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Responsible Responsive Design by Scott Jehl (from $9)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Jehl&amp;#8217;s new book is a great addition to the A Book Apart library. He takes a look at the next level of responsive design as a practice: speed, overcoming performance issues on troublesome networks and delivering appropriate assets across the vast array of different platforms and conditions we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abookapart.com/products/&quot;&gt;A Book Apart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Responsive Sketch Pad ($16)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7523/15230413133_93895d195f_b.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;I try not to take the &amp;#8220;screens&amp;#8221; too seriously – the boxed areas are enough for me to figure out how elements work in a given space&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use my Responsive Sketch Pad pretty much every day. Its great for quickly drawing components in a narrow column and figuring out how they translate to larger spaces. Apparently it works well with UI Stencil&amp;#8217;s pixel ruler — I didn&amp;#8217;t realise such a thing existed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uistencils.com/products/responsive-sketch-pad&quot;&gt;UI Stencils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Invision App (Free with paid plans starting from $15 per month)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll have to confess that I have only started using Invision App picked up recently, but already the benefits are obvious and it feels like the missing link that holds the whole design and development process together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From keeping designers and developers singing from the same hymnsheet, to fostering design feedback discussion and iterations — Invision has you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.invisionapp.com&quot;&gt;Invision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Typecast (from $19 per month)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typecast is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best tool for creating beautiful and usable typography for the web. It saves scouring the many different web font services available by bringing them together in a unified font selection UI. Typecast allows you to easily set your vertical rhythm, change properties over different media queries, play with font feature settings — everything you could imagine doing with web type can be done in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typecast.com&quot;&gt;Typecast&lt;/a&gt; or free with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fonts.com&quot;&gt;fonts.com&lt;/a&gt; account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Great Discontent, Issue One ($30)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8581/15227790624_2522fa427e_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Weighing in at an impressive 272 pages on high quality paper, it&amp;#8217;s the perfect desk companion for a healthy dose of inspiration&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a fan of Ryan and Tina Essmaker&amp;#8217;s The Great Discontent for quite some time now — in fact, it has been my go-to example of responsive web design when I&amp;#8217;m explaining it to clients. The inspiring interviews from the series come to life in high quality print with design and art direction from Frank Chimero.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A silent web</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime during the last decade the web fell silent. There was a time when Flash-based websites with autoplaying background music were commonplace and the Internet felt like a lively, noisy place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the present day and websites have turned quiet apart from certain media elements like video where the user can give explicit permission to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I believe this is better than websites that continuously sing at the user on an autoplaying loop, I think we maybe went too far in the condemnation of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of audio on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider audio as component of the user interface for a moment: what&amp;#8217;s wrong with using a sound like pips to represent hovering on menu options?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potentially good for accessibility where blind and partially sighted users might struggle to see a hover state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound could form part of the look and &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of the experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And additionally it can help with other facets of the experience like helping a user feel a sense of achievement after completing a task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The user is accustomed to a quiet web and the sound could come as an unwelcome shock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From an accessibility standpoint - there would need to be some sort of standard to indicate hover states which could confuse blind and partially sighted users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When audio was mainstream on many websites it was during a time where volume controls were disconnected from the device - potentially hidden on part of a CRT monitor or detached on external speakers. This was likely a source of frustration where you would have to move from a comfortable position to turn down the volume. Today we are well accustomed to use devices with mute buttons when we don&amp;#8217;t want our apps to make any noise - the same applies to desktop for the most part where mute buttons are part of the keyboard functions. Audio has a definitive off switch should the user choose to opt out of all audio, and I&amp;#8217;d wager that most folks know that if they want their device to be quiet - they&amp;#8217;ll put it in silent mode (or mute for laptops and desktops).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should apps get all the fun of satisfying interface chirps and clicks when flowing through the experience? What if the games industry decided to go quiet in regards to their main menu systems? Both industries are trying achieve the same goal: to facilitate the user in completing a task. The game and app industries have audio as an integral part of UX whereas our industry opted to avoid it in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we wrote off audio too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I test type and layout</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#8217;d elaborate on my testing strategy that I introduced during a talk I gave recently for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typecast.com/seminars&quot;&gt;Typecast&amp;#8217;s seminar series&lt;/a&gt;. I described how I use two different testing methods for typography and responsive layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are two very different facets of the same overall system and subsequently require different test conditions. In essence, I test typography on devices and I test layout in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mobile devices aren&amp;#8217;t great for layout testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Device stands may look pretty on your desk, but they&amp;#8217;re not going to cover all the possible states of a responsive layout. In fact, testing layouts purely on a set of devices is no different than designing for a set of predefined weights and heights — devices let you see how a layout will act at a particular size, but that&amp;#8217;s the only size you&amp;#8217;ll see on that screen&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:p93444774181-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:p93444774181-1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I do the majority of my layout testing in the browser. A browser will let you see all the in-between states that a set of devices won&amp;#8217;t let you see. Expanding and collapsing the browser window from the small compressed state to an uncompressed wide state like an accordion allows you to see your elements actively respond and helps identify any potential gaps or problem areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the actual device will show you the definitive state for that particular device - but what about every other permutation of the responsive layout?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desktop browser helps paint the complete layout picture. No modern mobile browser gets the basic fundamentals of CSS layout so wrong that it requires you to refresh and investigate every layout change[^1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Desktop browsers aren&amp;#8217;t great for testing type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where a desktop browser excels at showing you the difference in screen sizes, shapes and dimensions - it fails to account for the potential differences in type rendering between browsers and operating systems. A single browser window can only show you how type renders for that individual display and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast array of different mobile device displays requires a testing setup that caters for the variance in different screen densities, resolutions and screen types to give an indication of how type renders in these different environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An electronic ink display might render the type blurry compared to the display of a crisp high density screen. This is where a broad set of devices comes in handy - it pays to stress test your fonts across the often unforgiving and varied display properties of mobile devices. A single desktop browser won&amp;#8217;t let you know about any of these potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The best of both worlds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still reference mobile browsers during layout testing from time to time - functional testing is a different matter where I test heavily on all devices - but primarily my &lt;em&gt;layout&lt;/em&gt; testing happens in the browser and my type testing happens on mobile displays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed and efficiency of scaling a desktop browser window from small to large for building &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; responsive layouts met with a set of devices that represent as much of the potential difference in display types is the sweet spot that works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn:p93444774181-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from different orientations if the device allows it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:p93444774181-1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Emmet&#39;s hidden power features</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emmet.io/&quot;&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Zen Coding) is a plugin for text editors helping you create CSS and HTML faster by using abbreviations to write common values saving ridiculous amounts of time along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are heaps of really useful features alongside Emmet&amp;#8217;s primary text-expanding function. Here are a few of the hidden gems that I frequently use when coding&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:p91335536701-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:p91335536701-1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inline Calculation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmet has a built-in calculator which allows you to solve equations directly in your code. I use this daily to solve EM values in CSS, particularly for nested EM values simply by pressing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:p91335536701-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:p91335536701-2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Cmd&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;Y&lt;/kbd&gt; beside an equation like: 24/16 (desired pixel value/base pixel value).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also chain this with abbreviations, so typing: &lt;code&gt;mb24/16&lt;/code&gt; and pressing &lt;kbd&gt;Cmd&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;Y&lt;/kbd&gt; then &lt;kbd&gt;tab&lt;/kbd&gt; would output: &lt;code&gt;margin-bottom: 1.5em&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jump to Matching Pair&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when coding HTML I might find a closing tag and it&amp;#8217;s not always quick and easy to trace back to where the opening tag exists. Pressing &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;T&lt;/kbd&gt; when the cursor is in the closing (or opening) tag jumps to the opening (or closing) tag pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Code comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent running into the situation in the previous tip, I recommend placing comments beside your closing tags. But writing the class name of the element for a second time and wrapping it in comments can take up time, and it&amp;#8217;s extra effort that won&amp;#8217;t be beneficial until you run into scenarios where you need to revisit that code, so it&amp;#8217;s often forgotten about or left out completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully Emmet makes it easier to write comments beneath closing tags by adding a tiny snippet to the end of an abbreviation. Typing: &lt;code&gt;.container&amp;gt;ul&amp;gt;li*5&amp;gt;a|c&lt;/code&gt; expands to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- /.container --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So writing comments where elements close is as easy as writing &lt;code&gt;|c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Convert image to Data URI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most underused features of Emmet is it&amp;#8217;s built-in ability to convert images to data:URI schemes. Using a data:URI instead of linking to an external image saves an extra HTTP request which ultimately improves the performance of your site by reducing latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To convert an image to a data:URI, place your cursor in the image tag and press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;D&lt;/kbd&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmet can be as powerful as you want it to be. It&amp;#8217;s worth using for its text-expansion capabilities alone saving huge amounts of coding time, but beyond that lies a very powerful suite of development tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn:p91335536701-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article assumes you are familiar with Emmet. If you haven&amp;#8217;t tried it out yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://emmet.io/&quot;&gt;you absolutely must&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:p91335536701-1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn:p91335536701-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard shortcuts shown here work for my Mac installation of Sublime Text and Emmet. From what I can tell they may differ between installations, Windows installs will obviously have different shortcuts too. Bring up the Go To Anything menu and start typing the name of the command you wish to use to see the shortcut key. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:p91335536701-2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>SVG&#39;s missing killer feature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SVG has all the attributes for becoming the responsive web&amp;#8217;s image format of choice. Built for scalability SVG is inherently resolution independent. You&amp;#8217;d think it would be omnipresent in websites existing after the introduction of responsive web design in 2010. It isn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why don&amp;#8217;t we use SVG? Why sidestep it in favour of a raster image inflated to double its intended display size? SVG lacks a killer feature that is present in JPG, PNG and GIF: &lt;strong&gt;convenience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphics editing packages such as Photoshop treat SVG as an edge case. You can export SVGs from such applications but in an inconvenient, hacky way known only to some in the darkest corners of StackOverflow. Some of these &amp;#8220;solutions&amp;#8221; involve stripping the scalability out of the format to ensure it plays nicely in Photoshop’s restrictive parameters. In addition to that, my experience of patching that behaviour into applications has produced SVGs with varied results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended route would be to close Photoshop and open an alternative package that allows you to easily import and export SVGs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator, but it would be foolish to think that these applications have been ingrained into web design culture at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making an SVG shouldn&amp;#8217;t feel like going beyond the call of duty, nor should it require patching functionality into our current software. Perhaps when the big decision makers in hardware roll out even higher density displays beyond double density then it might expose the pixelated shortcomings of icons and other web assets built using oversized raster images. Maybe then we’ll see that the benefits of SVG outweigh the cost and convenience makes way for necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>View full site - the worst anti-pattern</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The “view full site” link has fostered a negative behavioural trait. When faced with problems on a dedicated mobile site users have a tendency to look for the full site link like some sort of safety net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often have you arrived on a broken link on a dedicated mobile site from a search engine and looked for the full site link in an attempt to solve the problem? It’s instinctive among web savvy people, but I have witnessed people outside of our industry perform the same behavioural trait in a similar unconscious manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad truth is “view full site” can also be used by web developers as a safety net if the small screen experience isn’t good enough. The pinch-to-zoom fallback is there when a poor implementation fails and lazy web developers capitalise on the user’s newfound habits of correcting such website issues by clicking this magical link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves responsive designers in a difficult position. We are already on the back foot when the user arrives at our lovingly tailored responsive experience — we have to convince the user that our responsive design &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the full experience after years of being misled to think they are getting half a product by dedicated mobile sites overzealous in removing content and stripping back features&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that from the average user’s perspective a dedicated mobile site may not look too different to a responsive site on the surface. If they run into problems with our design or perhaps they expected to see some content that is missing because it was simply overlooked, do they feel misled by default?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we fix this problem? By continuing to fight the good fight with ubiquitous experiences and earning back the user’s trust over time — it’s not going to be a quick fix. Bad habits take time to eradicate. The great content swindle needs to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Web Designer&#39;s Holiday Gift Guide 2013</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now for something a little different. With Christmas around the corner I thought I’d share a collection of great gift ideas for your fellow web designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pencil&lt;/span&gt; from $49.95&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2849/11298395685_e931227fd5_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty Three are best known for their impeccably designed and critically acclaimed Paper app for iPad. Now Paper has a hardware companion — Pencil. The milled, graphite brushed aluminium finish provides a good grip that compliments the carpenter pencil form and the eraser on the opposite end of the point does exactly as you’d expect in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil&quot;&gt;Fifty Three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Slate&lt;/span&gt; from $98&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7430/11298421256_9f2158c1f4_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really neat idea. Slate is a portable desk that houses your laptop and a mobile device on your lap whilst providing you with space to take notes or even use a mouse. The holes beneath the space for your laptop helps keep your legs and your computer cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iskelter/slate-mobile-airdesk&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Device Lab stand&lt;/span&gt; $149&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5505/11298395725_3fe44ea3d5_c.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A must for the responsive web designer. This device stand from Vanamco houses up to 6 devices leaving a gutter for USB and charging cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://devicelab.vanamco.com&quot;&gt;Vanamco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;UINK.it Stamp&lt;/span&gt; from $35&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/11298395605_bbcc8bd1bf_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketches are an interface designer’s best friend. They’re quick and easy to produce — devices however are not. When producing mobile UIs it helps to frame them but this takes away a lot of the flow and spontaneity that sketching brings. UINK.it solves that allowing you to stamp device templates anywhere you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1839712674/uinkit-stamp-user-interface-design-tool&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Platinum Pro-Use I 03 Drafting Pencil&lt;/span&gt; $16.50&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5509/11298421226_7873888226_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those wireframes aren’t going to draw themselves. This exquisite drafting pencil produces the perfect weight for fast wireframe production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Pro-Use-I-03-Drafting-Pencil-0.3-mm/pd/1458&quot;&gt;JetPens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gridbooks Web Book&lt;/span&gt; $24&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7323/11298395625_5102b92810_c.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gridbooks produce high quality notebooks for wireframing. Their Web Book features a 15-point dot grid that divides vertically into two, three, four, five and six columns with horizontal grids that can adapt to two, three, four, six, eight, twelve and sixteen columns. The opposing page features space for notes like objectives and goals to help keep you focused and produce great looking wireframes ready for sign-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gridbooks.com/products/web-book&quot;&gt;Gridbooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get Mental Notes&lt;/span&gt; Sold Out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3738/11297859585_fafea03da9_o.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental Notes are a set of 50 cards designed as both reference and brainstorming tool for psychological design. The first set of 5000 cards went in a flash, so make sure to get notified of when new batches arrive so you don’t miss out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getmentalnotes.com&quot;&gt;Get Mental Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Five Simple Steps Pocket Guides&lt;/span&gt; £19&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/11298395395_fb9e0c5d6e_o.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five Simple Steps’ popular Pocket Guides series have made the transition from digital to physical format seamlessly. The first set of books features works from The Standardistas, Brian Suda, Rachel Andrew and Joe Leech. You’ll also receive the digital editions when you buy the paperback versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/pocket-guides-collection-one&quot;&gt;Five Simple Steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cloud Typography subscription&lt;/span&gt; $99&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of Hoefler &amp;amp; Frere-Jones’ typefaces speak for themselves. Their long awaited web fonts service arrived earlier this year and the time taken to port their elegant library for the web shows in their ScreenSmart fonts. With packages starting from $99 per year it’s easy on the wallet too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typography.com/cloud/&quot;&gt;Hoefler &amp;amp; Frere-Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
