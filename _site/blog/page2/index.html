          <p class="post-meta">28 November 2013</p>
          <p>In the interest of openness I thought I’d share my set of design principles that I have been experimenting with for the last few weeks. They serve as a guide for design decisions and help me focus on good, honest values when making products for real people.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">25 November 2013</p>
          <p>Having authored work for Smashing Magazine in the past I know this for sure - they care a great deal about the quality of their content. They have an entire editorial team dedicated to scrutinising every word and every technical claim by contributors to their publication — which is an amazing thing because it is reflected in the high quality writing consumed by thousands every day.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">23 November 2013</p>
          <p>Our tools are antisocial. They don&#8217;t talk to each other very much, or very well, or <em>at all</em> most of the time. One tool does the editing, one does the uploading and another lets you see the result on the web. Some tools are negotiators, like CodeKit. They try to help everyone get along by becoming the invisible glue holding the whole operation together.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">19 November 2013</p>
          <p>Knowledge is a gift. Having a few years of experience in the web industry under my belt there are plenty of opportunities for prior knowledge to solve design problems. But knowledge comes with baggage. Knowledge stifles potential.</p>

          <p>The Chrome development team <a href="https://twitter.com/chromiumdev/status/401411675149975552">proudly announced</a> that they addressed one of the most common complaints from responsive designers about their browser - Chrome now let&#8217;s you resize your browser down to 320 pixels wide.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">15 November 2013</p>
          <p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is great for a number of reasons. It helps people unfamiliar with HTML write in a way that will render as valid, structured HTML with the appropriate tools behind the scenes that the writer doesn&#8217;t need to worry about.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">12 November 2013</p>
          <p>Our Twitter streams and RSS feeds are flooded with valuable new articles every day. Some I get time to read, some I don&#8217;t, some of the ideas within stick and some ideas simply don&#8217;t — that&#8217;s just the way it is with writing on the web as with any advice in life.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">11 November 2013</p>
          <p>Having recently covered the <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/2013/11/02/responding-to-environmental-lighting-with-css.html-media">luminosity media feature</a>, I thought I&#8217;d take time to document the potential use cases for the other new media features in the CSS Level 4 Media Queries module. Note that at the time of writing these features don&#8217;t exist in any browser yet, so the following use cases are theoretical.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">6 November 2013</p>
          <p>Until recently I would have insisted that web design <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a craft. Perhaps I felt terms like &#8220;handmade&#8221; and &#8220;handcrafted&#8221; were inappropriately used as an afterthought to add the suggestion of value to a product or service. Therefore I dismissed the notion of making things for the web having any association with craft.</p>

          <p>Recently I caught up with one of my good internet friends <a href="http://kevinsuttle.com">Kevin Suttle</a>. While he&#8217;s currently a designer, developer, writer, and presenter currently based in Cincinnati, Ohio, he&#8217;ll soon be joining the rebuilding of <a href="http://ibm.com/design">IBM Design</a> in Austin, Texas as a Senior Product Designer. He&#8217;s got some interesting stories to share, so I thought I would share them with you too.</p>
