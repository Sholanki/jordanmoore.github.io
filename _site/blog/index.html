          <p>A silly little tool to help you clean crap off your screen without switching off or logging out. Makes use of the fullscreen API for big screens and just rotate to clean small screens.</p>

          <p>My Instapaper feed looks a lot like my Steam account. I have gathered many items with the good intention of making use of them on a rainy day, but they eventually gather dust on their virtual shelves.</p>

          <p>It has been just over six months since I left agency life behind and started a new chapter in my career as a freelance designer.  Now is the perfect time to stop and reflect on what the last six months have been like and share my journey.</p>

          <p>I am delighted to announce that after 7 years working in web agencies I have decided to leave and start a new adventure as a freelance web designer.</p>

          <p>I don&#8217;t usually keep my cards close my chest, but I was very excited about building a little web app to counter the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/">recent, and in my opinion, misinformed</a> talk of the importance of &#8220;the fold&#8221; in web pages.</p>

          <p>There are few things on the Web that excite me more than a new HTML document its raw form and the possibilities it brings. In an unstyled HTML document the contents are laid bare for all to see. Out-of-the-box HTML comes with an established typographic hierarchy and elements are distinguishable like the different variations of lists that we seem to have a strange habit of resetting and stripping of the characteristics that make it a list.</p>

          <p>Sometime during the last decade the web fell silent. There was a time when Flash-based websites with autoplaying background music were commonplace and the Internet felt like a lively, noisy place to be.</p>
