          <p>Originally posted on The Pastry Box project, I explored the similar themes and motives between method actors and user experience professionals in the field of empathy for the roles they play in the respective industries.</p>

          <p>I am delighted to announce that after 7 years working in web agencies I have decided to leave and start a new adventure as a freelance web designer.</p>

          <p>I don&#8217;t usually keep my cards close my chest, but I was very excited about building a little web app to counter the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/">recent, and in my opinion, misinformed</a> talk of the importance of &#8220;the fold&#8221; in web pages.</p>

          <p>There are few things on the Web that excite me more than a new HTML document its raw form and the possibilities it brings.

          <p>Sometime during the last decade the web fell silent. There was a time when Flash-based websites with autoplaying background music were commonplace and the Internet felt like a lively, noisy place to be.</p>
