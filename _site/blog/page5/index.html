          <p>As you have probably noticed by now â€” I have a thing about magic. It has fascinated me since I was a young boy, particularly the tricks that would lead you down a path of thinking expecting a certain result only for it to produce an unexpected, yet astounding result.</p>

          <p>There are lots of solutions to address the problem of responsive images. The solutions share a similar set of requirements, some meet the majority of the requirements, some don&#8217;t and specialise in doing one thing well.</p>

          <p>Responsive Web Design allows us to change layouts and element appearance based upon the width and/or height of the destination device. It&#8217;s the ideal scenario for users, coders and content coordinators alike - same site, same code, same content, just optimised for your experience depending on the display properties of the device you are using.</p>

          <p>Remember those &#8220;HD Ready&#8221; stickers you used to see stuck in the corner of a flat screen TV? Back then retailers thought it was important to tell you that the TV you were about to buy is future-proof (that is to say it would be capable of displaying high resolution imagery when the technology arrives).</p>

          <p>The web is inherently responsive. It&#8217;s in it&#8217;s DNA. If you create a structured HTML document with no CSS applied and open it in any browser, you will see it is naturally fluid and will fit any window size.</p>

          <p>You probably heard about a little event in London this week called <a href="http://www.responsivesummit.com">Responsive Summit</a> - the brainchild of Josh Brewer and my work colleague Chris Armstrong. What started out as an informal chat between the two a week earlier ended up as a bigger discussion between more colleagues including Mark Boulton, Paul McKeever, Dan Mall, Paul Lloyd among others and of course the web community via Twitter.</p>

          <p>Responsive web design has naturally moved us away from the world of the finite canvas of tools like Photoshop and on to the infinite canvas of the the web. Those I know that design and build responsive layouts no longer use Photoshop as the pixel perfect representation of the site yet to be built and have moved towards designing in the browser instead.</p>
