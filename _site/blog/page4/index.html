          <p class="meta">30 March 2013</p>
          <p>I have spent the majority of this week wrestling with my conscience over the concept of allowing a user to switch a responsive design off. After a few healthy discussions and debates I&#8217;m still leaning towards thinking it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>

          <p class="meta">25 March 2013</p>
          <p>Earlier today Roger Johansson posted an article about potential scenarios for <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201303/letting_users_disable_responsive_layout/">disabling a responsive design</a> along with <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/disable-responsive-layout/">a demo</a>. As noted in the article, this isn&#8217;t new thinking as both <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2013/turning-off-responsive-web-design/">Bruce Lawson</a>, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/user-opt-out-responsive-design/">Chris Coyier</a> and various others have spoken about it before — the purpose was to introduce the demo along with scenarios where it would be useful.</p>

          <p class="meta">12 March 2013</p>
          <p>When designing for small screens keep in mind that everything you do is under the microscope - design patterns, interactions, usability, speed — everything. These wonderful little devices that we cup in our hands offer a small, personal and intimate window in which to enjoy the web.</p>

          <p class="meta">3 March 2013</p>
          <p>Maybe I am a bit of a control freak. When I make something, I want full editorial control over the visuals and the content. And maybe it&#8217;s the minimalist in me thinking &#8220;if it doesn&#8217;t add any value — remove it. Everything else is distraction&#8221;. I just can&#8217;t bring myself to switch on comments or social sharing buttons on this website — I can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;ll start with those shiny little not-quite-visually-similar-enough social buttons that tally up how many times your page has been shared on their networks via their JavaScript generated buttons.</p>

          <p class="meta">2 March 2013</p>
          <p>Recently Vasilis van Gemert authored a very useful article on Smashing Magazine about <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/01/logical-breakpoints-responsive-design/">Logical Breakpoints For Your Responsive Design</a>. The article touches on how it you could theoretically produce different reading lengths and breakpoints for different languages. To support this idea Vasilis introduces an insightful little tool showing how the contrasting word length between different languages influences reading length.</p>

          <p class="meta">11 December 2012</p>
          <p>Every so often in our industry a publication resonates with the concerns of the industry makers. It happened when Jeffery Zeldman released Designing with Web Standards in 2003 when the web standards movement was in full swing, it happened again in 2010 when Ethan Marcotte released Responsive Web Design which moved people to think differently about how we make things, and in my opinion - it has happened once again with Smashing Magazine&#8217;s <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/the-mobile-book.html">The Mobile Book</a>.</p>

          <p>This hilarious animated gif crafted by Tiago Franco (<a href="http://twitter.com/Alarka">@Alarka</a>) has probably been viewed by the entire web development community by now. It shows the responsive web designer&#8217;s instinctive grabbing of the browser handles whenever they open a new website. We all do it and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

          <p class="meta">4 October 2012</p>
          <p>I had an epiphany recently regarding one of the biggest concerns around adopting a responsive methodology for web projects — workflow.</p>

          <p>A stub is the part of a document torn off and kept as a record, it usually resides at the end of documents like cheques, receipts and tickets.</p>

          <p>We are accustomed to the phrase &#8220;design patterns&#8221; which encompasses an established solution to a design problem consisting of purpose, function and appearance. There are lots of libraries cataloging these solutions to help designers and developers make sensible decisions when designing and building a product.</p>
