          <p>I count myself lucky to work in such an exciting industry. When friends or family outside of web design circles ask me about my job I tell them that it is exciting. I often tell them that &#8220;No two days are the same&#8221;. In a recent moment of clarity I realised that there are very few parameters in our work that stay the same. The web as a medium changes every day, in fact it is <strong>changing all the time</strong>.</p>

          <p>On July 14th 2011 Trent Walton published an article introducing the concept of <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/">Content Choreography</a>. The article opened my mind and made me question some of the limitations we face in how we build responsive experiences. At the time content reordering and reflow hadn&#8217;t been widely explored beyond JavaScript-based solutions and I had been experimenting a lot with flexbox to reorder and arrange items horizontally for <a href="http://www.typecast.com">Typecast&#8217;s</a> UI. When Trent spoke about content stacking, I started to think what was achievable for reordering content along the y-axis in a single column layout.</p>

          <p>When we design we generally do so in two dimensions — length and width. They are the physical constraints of what our technology is currently capable of. Our dimensional restraints are then realised on the devices used to experience our design.</p>

          <p>The craft of <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/combining-typefaces">combining typefaces</a> can feel like a daunting prospect. It’s easy to shy away from the adventurous cross-pollination of different typefaces and stick to families and superfamilies to achieve typographic harmony.</p>

          <p>Earlier today Roger Johansson posted an article about potential scenarios for <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201303/letting_users_disable_responsive_layout/">disabling a responsive design</a> along with <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/disable-responsive-layout/">a demo</a>. As noted in the article, this isn&#8217;t new thinking as both <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2013/turning-off-responsive-web-design/">Bruce Lawson</a>, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/user-opt-out-responsive-design/">Chris Coyier</a> and various others have spoken about it before — the purpose was to introduce the demo along with scenarios where it would be useful.</p>

          <p>When designing for small screens keep in mind that everything you do is under the microscope - design patterns, interactions, usability, speed — everything. These wonderful little devices that we cup in our hands offer a small, personal and intimate window in which to enjoy the web.</p>

          <p>Maybe I am a bit of a control freak. When I make something, I want full editorial control over the visuals and the content. And maybe it&#8217;s the minimalist in me thinking &#8220;if it doesn&#8217;t add any value — remove it. Everything else is distraction&#8221;. I just can&#8217;t bring myself to switch on comments or social sharing buttons on this website — I can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;ll start with those shiny little not-quite-visually-similar-enough social buttons that tally up how many times your page has been shared on their networks via their JavaScript generated buttons.</p>

          <p>Recently Vasilis van Gemert authored a very useful article on Smashing Magazine about <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/01/logical-breakpoints-responsive-design/">Logical Breakpoints For Your Responsive Design</a>. The article touches on how it you could theoretically produce different reading lengths and breakpoints for different languages. To support this idea Vasilis introduces an insightful little tool showing how the contrasting word length between different languages influences reading length.</p>

          <p>This hilarious animated gif crafted by Tiago Franco (<a href="http://twitter.com/Alarka">@Alarka</a>) has probably been viewed by the entire web development community by now. It shows the responsive web designer&#8217;s instinctive grabbing of the browser handles whenever they open a new website. We all do it and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
