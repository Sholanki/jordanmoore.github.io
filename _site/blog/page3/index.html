          <p class="post-meta">5 November 2013</p>
          <p>Recently I caught up with one of my good internet friends <a href="http://kevinsuttle.com">Kevin Suttle</a>. While he&#8217;s currently a designer, developer, writer, and presenter currently based in Cincinnati, Ohio, he&#8217;ll soon be joining the rebuilding of <a href="http://ibm.com/design">IBM Design</a> in Austin, Texas as a Senior Product Designer. He&#8217;s got some interesting stories to share, so I thought I would share them with you too.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">4 November 2013</p>
          <p>I can only speculate why Safari hasn&#8217;t been widely adopted for web development — maybe it&#8217;s because Safari isn&#8217;t an overly popular browser, or perhaps it&#8217;s because it hasn&#8217;t been too developer friendly in the past. Safari&#8217;s web developer tools always felt like they were playing catch up with Chrome and Firefox, they seemed clunky and cumbersome by comparison. Thankfully the same can&#8217;t be said for Safari in Mavericks.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">2 November 2013</p>
          <p><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/">Media Queries Level 4</a> builds upon the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">existing media queries specification</a> that many of us use when we build responsive designs today. The Media Queries Level 4 specification introduces four interesting new media features - <strong>script</strong>, <strong>hover</strong>, <strong>pointer</strong> and <strong>luminosity</strong>. At the time of writing the specification has yet to be implemented in a browser, but that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from exploring the potential use cases.</p>

          <p>I have been using <a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">xScope</a> for about 6 months, and I&#8217;m quite late to the party. It has been around for years and has long been the web developer&#8217;s Swiss Army Knife. It is a suite of tools that help make designing for the web a lot easier.</p>

          <p>Until recently this very blog you are reading sported a dashing, large, full-width image atop each article. It took a considerable amount of time to trawl through all of my previous articles and match them with a suitable image so each article adhered to the new template design.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">15 September 2013</p>
          <p>I count myself lucky to work in such an exciting industry. When friends or family outside of web design circles ask me about my job I tell them that it is exciting. I often tell them that &#8220;No two days are the same&#8221;. In a recent moment of clarity I realised that there are very few parameters in our work that stay the same. The web as a medium changes every day, in fact it is <strong>changing all the time</strong>.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">17 June 2013</p>
          <p>On July 14th 2011 Trent Walton published an article introducing the concept of <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/">Content Choreography</a>. The article opened my mind and made me question some of the limitations we face in how we build responsive experiences. At the time content reordering and reflow hadn&#8217;t been widely explored beyond JavaScript-based solutions and I had been experimenting a lot with flexbox to reorder and arrange items horizontally for <a href="http://www.typecast.com">Typecast&#8217;s</a> UI. When Trent spoke about content stacking, I started to think what was achievable for reordering content along the y-axis in a single column layout.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">14 May 2013</p>
          <p>I have a brief observation to make about the already saturated conversation of Photoshop vs designing in the browser. Flat compositions and designing with code are part of the same philosophy of web design, you just need to be mindful of how you use them.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">6 May 2013</p>
          <p>When we design we generally do so in two dimensions — length and width. They are the physical constraints of what our technology is currently capable of. Our dimensional restraints are then realised on the devices used to experience our design.</p>

          <p>The craft of <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/combining-typefaces">combining typefaces</a> can feel like a daunting prospect. It’s easy to shy away from the adventurous cross-pollination of different typefaces and stick to families and superfamilies to achieve typographic harmony.</p>
