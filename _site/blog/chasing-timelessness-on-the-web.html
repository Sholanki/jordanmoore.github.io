    <p>Cameron Koczon wrote a <a href="http://m.alistapart.com/articles/an-important-time-for-design/">rousing piece for the latest issue of A List Apart</a> today with a lot of useful advice and observations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to think about products over posters and people over page views. We need this to happen at every level: in design schools, in design writing, and in the things we celebrate online and in person. We have a new purpose: elevate design and help change the world. Let’s talk about how to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The web is maturing as a medium. As we move away from the cheap, tacky, disposable designs that accompanied Web 2.0, we enter a phase where quality content is complimented by more considered design. Publications like <a href="http://methodandcraft.com/">Method and Craft</a> and <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/">The Great Discontent</a> are obvious examples of the shift towards finer content where recently our feed readers were full of sites publishing lists of techniques and plugins.</p>

<p>We strive for timelessness on this medium that is inherently temporary, and I feel that comes naturally as we learn the strengths and weaknesses of the web as a platform and the tools we use. By pushing such boundaries we make better things as a result from our learning. It is no longer deemed acceptable to produce a web product for one device which may be replaced by another device tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just like Jeffery Zeldman led the web standards movement, great thinkers like Ethan Marcotte lead the way for the web&#8217;s next phase of making quality things that work where the web works, making things that last.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We get to go make things. Things that nudge the world a little bit in what we hope is the right direction. We get to put a dent in the universe. This is a great job.</p>
  
  <p>~ Wilson Miner</p>

        <p>Owning a set of mobile devices for testing has its benefits, but not necessarily for finding layout bugs. A varied set of screen densities however is invaluable for testing readability.</p>
