                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>Having recently covered the <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/2013/11/02/responding-to-environmental-lighting-with-css.html-media">luminosity media feature</a>, I thought I&#8217;d take time to document the potential use cases for the other new media features in the CSS Level 4 Media Queries module. Note that at the time of writing these features don&#8217;t exist in any browser yet, so the following use cases are theoretical.</p>

<h3>Introducing Script</h3>

<p>The <code>script</code> media feature does largely the same job as <a href="http://modernizr.com">existing feature detection methods</a> albeit on a more limited scale (browsers that support CSS level 4 media queries). It checks to see if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAscript</a> (commonly in the form of JavaScript on the web) is supported in the current document. That means if a user has JavaScript enabled or disabled in their browser, we can detect its state and make appropriate formatting adjustments in CSS.</p>

<p>There are certain limitations to what the <code>script</code> media feature can detect. If JavaScript is switched off and a page is loaded, the media feature will correctly report a value of &#8220;0&#8221; and it will report a value of &#8220;1&#8221; when JavaScript is enabled. But what happens to the media feature result when the user switches JavaScript off <em>whilst viewing the page</em> depends on the individual browser&#8217;s behaviour — it may or may not report a value of &#8220;0&#8221;. It also can&#8217;t be used as a way of providing a fallback if JavaScript errors cause something to break<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-1"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> because the browser will correctly say that the current document is capable of showing scripts and return a value of &#8220;1&#8221;. The specification hints at future levels of CSS being able to provide fine-grained results of which scripts are allowed to run on a page<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-2"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Use cases for script</h3>

<p>Using the &#8220;not&#8221; keyword in a <code>script</code> media query would allow us to style fallbacks where JavaScript isn&#8217;t enabled. It could also be used for progressive enhancement where the presence of JavaScript isn&#8217;t taken for granted.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a <code>script</code> media query written with progressive enhancement in mind (assuming we have a JavaScript-powered carousel):</p>

<pre>
<code>
@media (script) {
    .carousel-links {
        display:inline-block;
                padding: 0.3em 0.6em;
                ...
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Introducing Hover</h3>

<p>Similar to the <code>script</code> media feature <code>hover</code> returns a basic on/off (1/0) result depending on whether the primary pointing system on the device can hover<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-3"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Although touch-based devices may have the potential for hover capable input devices like a mouse, this media query will still report a value of &#8220;0&#8221; before any peripherals are attached.</p>

<p>The <code>hover</code> media feature solves a very common problem. Some UI elements that require a hover interacting like mega drop-down navigation menus often appear on touch-based devices that aren&#8217;t capable of hover functions. Their appearance is usually triggered by media queries based on screen dimensions which is not a reliable method for knowing if a device is capable of touch and/or hover inputs.</p>

<p>Currently the user agent on a touch device mimics a hover in some cases on the first tap of the hover menu item which seems to apply some sort of :hover and :active state. The point is — it&#8217;s not that reliable or user friendly. It takes a bit of guess work for the user to know a single tap activates hover. Thankfully the <code>hover</code> media query can help us fix this issue — as you&#8217;ve probably guessed, it detects the device&#8217;s ability to hover.</p>

<h3>Use cases for hover</h3>

<p>Upon detection of a hover-capable input device we could format our markup to enhance interfaces for such devices (e.g. drop-down menus, tooltips etc).</p>

<p>If we wanted drop down menus to only appear on devices that have hover input devices connected, then we would write:</p>

<pre>
<code>
@media (hover) {
    nav ul ul {
        display:none;
                /* Hide the sub menu and position absolutely to the parent li for a CSS-based hover drop down menu */
                ...
    }
        nav ul li:hover ul {
            display:block;
            /* Show the menu on hover of the parent li */
        }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Introducing Pointer</h3>

<p><code>Pointer</code> was generally thought of a way to differentiate between touch and other peripheral-based inputs. The media query produces 3 different values: <strong>none</strong>, <strong>coarse</strong> and <strong>fine</strong> — the assumption being that when implemented a non-touch or mouse-based device (like the 4th generation Kindles) would report &#8220;none&#8221;, an iPhone and iPad would report a value of &#8220;coarse&#8221; and a desktop machine would report &#8220;fine&#8221;.</p>

<p>Coarse means that the pointer limited accuracy. According to the spec<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-4"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, that means that at a zoom level of 1 (your default zoom level) the pointing device would have trouble accurately selecting several small adjacent targets.</p>

<p>Inputs that would give a value of fine would likely be a mouse, a trackpad or even a stylus.</p>

<p>I have a couple of reservations about the <code>pointer</code> media feature and I can see potential misuse or misunderstanding of it.</p>

<p>A potential limitation might be when peripherals are used after the page load. For example would the media query update it&#8217;s values if I decided to switch to a stylus during browsing? Also the spec notes that for accessibility reasons some user agents may report a value of &#8220;coarse&#8221; in an environment where the input would normally be reported as &#8220;fine&#8221;.</p>

<p>The takeaway from all of this? Don&#8217;t rely on a coarse pointer to mean <em>touch</em>. Loading touch UI elements based on the accuracy of the input device is trying to solve a problem with the wrong tools. We should take pointer accuracy at face value — it can only tell us how accurate the input device is, therefore our formatting changes within a <code>pointer</code> media query should only make adjustments to for accuracy rather than input type. If you want to write CSS for touch enabled devices <a href="http://modernizr.com">use Modernizr</a> to detect touch capabilities because relying on the <code>pointer</code> media feature is like relying on a width media query to definitively say &#8220;this browser is a mobile phone&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Use cases for pointer</h3>

<p>The specification provides a good use case where you could theoretically enlarge tricky targets like radio buttons based on the accuracy of the pointer. Perhaps &#8220;coarse&#8221; would be a good default to work from - if we assume that the device is inaccurate then we can progressively enhance for accuracy.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how we could potentially improve accuracy on UI elements for devices with inaccurate pointers and reduce their size for devices with accurate pointers:</p>

<pre>
<code>
@media (pointer:coarse) {
  .btn {
        padding: 1.2em 2em;
        font-size: 1.6em;
  }
}

@media (pointer:fine) {
  .btn {
        padding: 0.6em 1em;
        font-size: 1em;
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The new media features offer great opportunities to progressively enhance our designs. I don&#8217;t think any of them should form the <em>foundation</em> for a design, nor do I think that they were ever intended to be used in such a way. What they do provide is a way for us to finesse the details. Make sure to check <a href="http://jordanm.co.uk/palmreader">PalmReader</a> to see when the new media features arrive on your device.</p>

                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/">Media Queries Level 4</a> builds upon the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">existing media queries specification</a> that many of us use when we build responsive designs today. The Media Queries Level 4 specification introduces four interesting new media features: <strong>script</strong>, <strong>hover</strong>, <strong>pointer</strong> and <strong>luminosity</strong>. At the time of writing the specification has yet to be implemented in a browser, but that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from exploring the potential use cases.</p>

<p>The luminosity media feature has garnered interest from the web community, it will allow developers to make CSS adjustments based on changes in the ambient lighting in which the device is used. The user&#8217;s device must be equipped with a light sensor to trigger this new media feature.</p>

<p>The most obvious use case for the luminosity media feature is to adapt a design depending on whether the user is reading the page during the day where ambient lighting is brighter or during the night where ambient lighting is darker. We already see this behaviour in a few native apps.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7352/10715274745_2bb3cf0db0_o.png"/><figcaption><a href="http://digg.com/reader">Digg Reader</a> on iOS can change its theme depending on the brightness of the environmental lighting</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The thing about designing for the web is we don&#8217;t have the same prior knowledge of the destination device that designers for native apps do. The light sensor&#8217;s sensitivity on an iOS device might be different than an Android device, and the light sensor&#8217;s sensitivity on an Android device might be different to the light sensor of <em>another</em> Android device, so we would need to be careful with the degree of change we make as it could be jarring to devices that have an overly keen light sensor.</p>

<p>The code looks something like this:
<code></code></p>

<pre>
@media (luminosity: normal) {
    body {
        background: #f5f5f5;
        color: #262626;
    }
}
@media (luminosity: dim) {
    body {
        background: #e9e4e3;
    }
}
@media (luminosity: washed) {
    body {
        background: #ffffff;
    }
}
</pre>



<p>A <strong>normal</strong> luminosity level represents the screen being viewed in ideal lighting conditions. I would recommend working from this level as your default — and rather than wrapping those styles in a media query targeted for normal luminosity levels it would probably be best to leave those styles unwrapped so browsers and devices that haven&#8217;t got the capability of seeing the luminosity media feature can see the page in it&#8217;s ideal condition. You can then use the <strong>dim</strong> value to make adjustments for darker environments and <strong>washed</strong> to adjust styles for brighter environments leaving the default styles accessible to all devices whether they are equipped with a light sensor or not.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier about the potential differences in the light sensor hardware sensitivity — I think this is a key reason not to go over the top with the changes we make within luminosity media queries. Can we definitively say that a cloud passing on front of the sun will not trigger the <strong>dim</strong> luminosity media feature? The last thing I&#8217;d imagine the user wants is a harsh change between light and dark designs that is too easily triggered.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2882/10715357844_0ec5fc935b_o.jpg"/><figcaption>Potential stylesheet changes from dark to light environments (left to right). Subtle changes in contrast are key for avoiding a jarring user experience when environmental changes occur</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>As with other facets of web design, we should strive to stay out of the user&#8217;s way when they are trying to enjoy our design. The luminosity media feature has the potential to be the most annoying media query at our disposal, it could be responsible for ushering in a new era of glow in the dark websites — let&#8217;s just be careful with it when it arrives.</p>

                <p>I count myself lucky to work in such an exciting industry. When friends or family outside of web design circles ask me about my job I tell them that it is exciting. I often tell them that &#8220;No two days are the same&#8221;. In a recent moment of clarity I realised that there are very few parameters in our work that stay the same. The web as a medium changes every day, in fact it is <strong>changing all the time</strong>.</p>

<p>The television industry broadcasts to a specified aspect ratio. This aspect ratio fits the dimensions of TV sets and the broadcast is either squashed or stretched to fit the image depending on the size of the set. The viewer has limited control over what they see and how they see it. Using their remote control, they might have an option to change the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3 which distorts the image and breaks the broadcaster&#8217;s intended design.</p>

<p>The newspaper industry generally operates to either broadsheet or tabloid sizes on a paper canvas. The reader has slightly more control than the TV viewer, they can fold the paper and take it with them or perhaps fold it to make it easier to hold and read. However this breaks the publisher&#8217;s intended design. The graphics and the text are broken between a line through the layout originating from the reader&#8217;s fold.</p>

<p>The web industry is more complex. The web is constantly in a state of flux. There are <strong>no</strong> absolutes. You could almost say that no two users computers are the same. Think about the parameters that affect how our work is observed: different screen widths and heights is an obvious example, but look deeper at the additional parameters that can affect screen size — in Chrome some users prefer to browse with the bookmarks bar in view, some without. Some people might have additional toolbars that reduce the viewing area further meaning their experience will be slightly different to someone else&#8217;s. Other factors that affect how someone sees our design include different colour profiles between browsers, different colour profiles between monitors, manually adjusted colours and contrasts, browser extensions that block advertisements, browser extensions that block <em>design</em> and show only the content, browser extensions that add functionality and manipulate designs like Skype&#8217;s phone number extension — just to name a few.</p>

<p>Under the hood of the browser a slight difference in the version number could introduce any number of tweaks that affect a user&#8217;s experience of a page — perhaps the javascript engine has been improved meaning user A&#8217;s computer presents your design better than user B&#8217;s computer. Maybe the font hinting has been tweaked between a revision number, Flash might be disabled or enabled, experimental features might be active or inactive, and diving deeper into version numbers — a browser version number might be the same between two computers but they might have different versions of Java™ or QuickTime plugins. I find it hard to believe that there are a wealth of identical environments viewing our designs, the notion of no two being the same doesn&#8217;t seem so far-fetched.</p>

<p>The mind-bending truth is that this is changing all the time at micro and macro levels. A plugin version number can change, a browser can update automatically, the web as a platform can change and <em>is</em> constantly changing. The only absolute is change.</p>

<p>We need to be ready to respond to change. Screen size is just one parameter, but look closer and you&#8217;ll find a host of differences that are not present in other media — this is what excites me about the web. We can be true to the nature of the web, adhere to the core values that change <em>slower</em> than the rest like fluidity, typography, engaging content and accept change.</p>

                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>On July 14th 2011 Trent Walton published an article introducing the concept of <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/">Content Choreography</a>. The article opened my mind and made me question some of the limitations we face in how we build responsive experiences. At the time content reordering and reflow hadn&#8217;t been widely explored beyond JavaScript-based solutions and I had been experimenting a lot with flexbox to reorder and arrange items horizontally for <a href="http://www.typecast.com">Typecast&#8217;s</a> UI. When Trent spoke about content stacking, I started to think what was achievable for reordering content along the y-axis in a single column layout.</p>

<h3>A tale of two syntaxes</h3>

<p>The flexible box model landscape has been through a series of fundamental changes since its introduction in 2009. The original syntax for declaring the property in CSS is still recognised in a lot of today&#8217;s popular browsers. The following 3 years brought two significant changes to the syntax mainly around the language used to specify flexbox properties.</p>

<p>The flexbox specification has been finalised since <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/2012/04/26/building-with-content-choreography.html">I wrote about using flexbox to tackle content choreography concerns in May 2012</a> so it&#8217;s a good time to revisit the approach. Although the new flexbox syntax has been agreed it has not been widely implemented. Since the spec was settled we have witnessed the release of new mobile operating systems like iOS 6 that boasted numerous updates to Safari - one of which <a href="http://bgr.com/2012/08/06/ios-6-beta-4-change-log-now-available/">refrained from implementing the new syntax</a> and reverted to the old 2009 syntax. At the time of writing it is unclear whether iOS 7 will feature the updated syntax. Android&#8217;s default browser still uses the old syntax although Chrome on Android uses the new syntax like its desktop counterpart. That leaves us in some sort of syntax-purgatory between the final specification and the 2009 syntax.</p>

<p>Luckily the changes between old and new flexbox won&#8217;t affect how we use it to reorder blocks of content, just how we write the code. Some repetition is required, much like writing vendor prefixes.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that flexbox <strong>is safe to use on the web today</strong> for content choreography. According to <a href="http://caniuse.com/flexbox">caniuse.com&#8217;s</a> global browser usage statistics 76.52% of users would be able to view a flexbox-based solution to content choreography at the time of writing. 23.48% might seem like a considerable amount of people, but when we break that figure down further it&#8217;s not quite so big. 23.48% takes the desktop versions of Internet Explorer into consideration and we don&#8217;t intend to use this solution that demographic.</p>

<p>Content choreography using flexbox is most reliable at the <strong>first major breakpoint</strong> (usually in a single column). It&#8217;s also easiest at this level because we are (largely) dealing with moving element blocks around vertically on the y-axis. When we approach content choreography from this angle we can <em>assume</em> most desktop browsers won&#8217;t see our reordered page. Looking again at the browser statistics for flexbox support among mobile browsers only 14.4% of users won&#8217;t see choreographed content.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t usually make decisions based on browser statistics, especially project-specific decisions, but for gauging a general sense of browser support for something previously thought of as an edge-case CSS property, I think it&#8217;s worth pointing out that it is as safe to use in this context as something trivial like the text-shadow property.</p>

<h3>A note about screenreaders</h3>

<p>Before we dive into code specifics, we need to talk about accessibility. Screen readers will not read an altered source order changed by flexbox. Instead they will read the original document order which makes for a jarring and confusing experience for users requiring a service like VoiceOver.</p>

<p>Some feel that for this reason it <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/335302203218735104">is better to make source order changes in JavaScript</a> rather than CSS although others counter that <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/335303118982103040">this hinders innovation</a> and screen readers simply must follow our lead in pushing the web forward as a platform.</p>

<p>I am firmly in favour of a CSS-based approach as this is fundamentally a layout change after the effect. Using JavaScript instead of CSS to achieve a layout goal that can otherwise be achieved in CSS feels like a Frankenstein approach. I feel it&#8217;s dragging us back to the dark ages instead of helping our platform mature. If we choose to remain stagnant on issues like this then it would be like encouraging the use of JavaScript for rollover states in 2013. The fact is we have flexbox at our disposal and specced for use in CSS, avoiding it is only going to encourage the makers of screen reading software to do the same.</p>

<h3>A solution for past, present and future</h3>

<p>Now that we have covered the fundamentals, there are a few simple considerations to account for when building with flexbox to achieve content choreography. I have found the following mindset helps:</p>

<ul><li>Start designing and building for mobile first (no-brainer)</li>
<li>Your DOM order is your <em>definitive</em> order. Build for this order first <em>before</em> addressing content choreography concerns. If you are unsure about your definitive source order, this is the DOM order shown when your layout <strong>has enough space</strong> to show everything you want to show in a sensible hierarchy. </li>
<li>This requires <strong>foresight</strong> — one of the most difficult skills in a responsive designer&#8217;s arsenal. The DOM order will act as the fallback order on devices with limited screen space and where flexbox doesn&#8217;t work (Opera Mini, Opera Mobile &lt; 12.0 etc). Use content choreography only if your layout <strong>needs</strong> it in your first breakpoint.</li>
<li>Address the past, present and future devices by using both flexbox syntaxes.</li>
</ul><p>All things considered the revised flexbox code for a definitive specification looks like something this<sup id="fnref:p53179333055-1"><a href="#fn:p53179333055-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<pre>
<code>
.container {
display: -moz-box;
display: -webkit-box;
display: -ms-flexbox;
display: -webkit-flex;
display: flex;
-moz-box-orient: vertical;
-webkit-box-orient: vertical;
-ms-flex-direction: column;
-webkit-flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column;
}

.nav {
  -webkit-box-ordinal-group: 1;
  -moz-box-ordinal-group: 1;
  -ms-flex-order: 1;
  -webkit-order: 1;
  order: 1;
}

...
</code>
</pre>

<p>I have updated the <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/lab/contentchoreography">original demo</a> so it considers the new syntax.</p>

<p>Flexbox is no longer the volatile experimental property it once was, now that we have a final specification in place and widespread support on mobile devices flexbox is a robust solution for content choreography exactly where we want it to be — where space is confined and some layout adjustment is required.</p>

                <p>When we design we generally do so in two dimensions — length and width. They are the physical constraints of what our technology is currently capable of. Our dimensional restraints are then realised on the devices used to experience our design.</p>

<p>Beyond the two dimensional screen exists the third dimension (and many other theorised dimensions) — the physical space in which our designs exist beyond the canvas. Here, all sorts of physical parameters affect how a person uses our design.</p>

<p>Consider the user&#8217;s physical space around them — perhaps they are lying on their side on the sofa or in bed and holding a mobile device with one hand. Can the design be enjoyed when a user&#8217;s is physically restricted from using two hands? Luke Wroblewski further elaborates on this idea in his <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1664">Testing One Thumb, One Eyeball article</a> detailing the test procedure for Polar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If people can get things done in time sensitive, limited dexterity situations, they&#8217;ll be even more efficient when we have their full attention and two-hands focused on our designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649">separate article</a> Luke details the reach of one thumb with the diagram below to show the considerations for positioning navigation. This is relevant to anything you want people to reach easily, for example if you had a single purpose web app, you might want to position the primary action in the safe zone just like Instagram does with their primary action (take picture).</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://static.lukew.com/tnav-touch-phones2.png" alt=""/><figcaption>Image from Luke Wroblewski&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649">Responsive Navigation: Optimizing for Touch Across Devices</a> article</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Beyond the canvas take into account where the thumb might hover while the device is in use. Sometimes people rest their thumb along the ridge of the hardware while others hover it over a portion of the screen poised to press something. This emphasises the importance of testing with real devices. Real hardware considers space in three dimensions whereas on-screen emulators put themselves into the two dimensional canvas free from physical distractions — it&#8217;s not really representative of the physical world we live in <strong>beyond the canvas</strong>.</p>
