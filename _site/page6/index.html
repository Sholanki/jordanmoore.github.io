                <p>Maybe I am a bit of a control freak. When I make something, I want full editorial control over the visuals and the content. And maybe it&#8217;s the minimalist in me thinking &#8220;if it doesn&#8217;t add any value — remove it. Everything else is distraction&#8221;. I just can&#8217;t bring myself to switch on comments or social sharing buttons on this website — I can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;ll start with those shiny little not-quite-visually-similar-enough social buttons that tally up how many times your page has been shared on their networks via their JavaScript generated buttons.</p>

<p>First of all, unless you are The Next Web, Mashable or another web giant attracting heaps of traffic on a daily basis, a social count button isn&#8217;t going to do you or your brand any favours. Picture this scenario: you arrive at a random article on this website, you notice social buttons and note that the article has been shared 0 times on Facebook, 1 time on Twitter and 0 on Google Plus. What is your first instinctive thought? Here&#8217;s what I think — if I spot the buttons before reading the content and notice that it hasn&#8217;t been shared, I immediately doubt the integrity of the author and the trust of the message from the website as a whole. I read a lot of articles on a daily basis and sometimes I&#8217;ll gauge the usefulness of article on the recency of the post vs the share count. Yes, it&#8217;s shallow, like judging a book by it&#8217;s cover although in my defence, there are a lot of &#8220;books&#8221; to get through, whether intentional or not a social button can read like a <strong>review</strong>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to tread over any ground that Oliver Reichenstein has already covered in his fantastic <a href="http://informationarchitects.net/blog/sweep-the-sleaze/">Sweep the Sleaze</a> article and  follow up (and you should read it next if you haven&#8217;t already) so I&#8217;ll talk about things from user perceptions rather than usage and mechanics<sup id="fnref:p44447032290-1"><a href="#fn:p44447032290-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. A low button count is <em>damaging</em>. That&#8217;s my opinion and you&#8217;ll have trouble convincing me otherwise. The low count can be a result of people sharing the article by other means, like using the native sharing options in an operating system like iOS or just through good old fashioned manual sharing by copying and pasting a link into your preferred social network. These methods aren&#8217;t going to add anything to the button count, it&#8217;ll remain embarrassingly low like a poor review. According to Oliver Reichenstein&#8217;s piece around 20% links shared on websites he surveyed were completed via a social button, the other 80% were manual shares. So we can conclude that the ROI is poor.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, if you are a running high traffic site and you want to use the buttons as some sort of demonstration of  popularity, then I guess that&#8217;s a viable use case albeit a bit egotistical. I would wager though that the people that use them are passive sharers and wouldn&#8217;t add any value to the piece you want them to share and they probably don&#8217;t have the influence you would like to spread your message further and to the right people.</p>

<p>Social buttons are tools created by social networks to benefit… social networks. They want to take the conversation off your page and onto their network. I&#8217;m fine with that because I made the conscious decision to leave comments off on my website, but just think about that for your project.</p>

<p>Speaking of comments, they can be as damaging and in some cases more damaging than a poor share count. For comments to work right you need to stay out of the user&#8217;s way and that means leaving them completely unfiltered and moderating later. Obviously this leaves your site open to trolling — but that&#8217;s the nature of the beast, the danger of comment roulette.</p>

<p>Think about it this way — we are publishers. Would the New York Times let someone wander into their offices off the street and write an unsolicited remark at the end of one of their articles? Imagine reading the front page of the New York Times and at the end of a finely written piece you find the words &#8220;First!&#8221; or &#8220;Great article thanks!&#8221;. It just looks trashy. Compliments are nice to receive but to publicly display them amongst a list of generic back-pats just doesn&#8217;t sit right with me. I don&#8217;t need someone to essentially say &#8220;Good hustle Moore!&#8221; after my content.</p>

<p>By now you have probably guessed my opinion of comment models on the web — it&#8217;s not that I think the standard comments model is broken, I just feel like it&#8217;s not a one-size-fits-all solution. If I wanted to open up a commenting system for my website, I would potentially do something like this:</p>

<ol><li>Write the article (no brainer)</li>
<li>Associate a hashtag with the article (or all articles) — a hook that I can look for on social networks</li>
<li>Make the effort to find people&#8217;s opinions on the piece on social networks (if they use the hashtag, then this is step is easy, if not, so what — just keep looking. Valuable opinions are worth mining for)</li>
<li>Revisit the article having gathered opinions and use the insightful thoughts to add value to my original content and credit the necessary people</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol><p>You might be thinking, that sounds like a lot of work — it is. But take note that while digging for opinions, I&#8217;m engaging with my audience, maybe asking them to elaborate on some comments, while building trust and integrity with my work. The beauty of an approach like this is that if something you write is completely wrong or you have missed a crucial point then you can find people that disagree (trolls or otherwise) engage with them and maybe even correct the original article with their views. The important part is you maintain <strong>full editorial control</strong>, not by altering their comments, but building upon their input and giving credit where it&#8217;s due.</p>

<p>People can add value to an article without the article being incorrect, they can elaborate on points which you can add to the end of the piece and improve it. I call it <strong>editorial comments</strong>.</p>

<p>When talking to clients about this stance on social interactions, I talk about it as part of a larger social media strategy. The old/common approach is a plug-in social media strategy — shiny buttons won&#8217;t carry out your social media strategy for you. You need to do that, it requires effort to do it properly. It&#8217;s not enough to slap some cheap JavaScript buttons onto your page and mark off the social media box of your project goals. A social button cannot become the voice of your brand, that&#8217;s a human&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re a performance hog too.

                <p>Recently Vasilis van Gemert authored a very useful article on Smashing Magazine about <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/01/logical-breakpoints-responsive-design/">Logical Breakpoints For Your Responsive Design</a>. The article touches on how it you could theoretically produce different reading lengths and breakpoints for different languages. To support this idea Vasilis introduces an insightful little tool showing how the contrasting word length between different languages influences reading length.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.tumblr.com/jdwzxqr/bx5mj0xoa/screen_shot_2013-03-02_at_08.16.28.png" alt="Cropped screenshot of The International Measure Slider"/></p>

<p>This tool is worth bookmarking if you are designing multi-lingual layouts. You can take it a step further by <strong>responding to the user’s language using CSS</strong>.</p>

<p>The language of an HTML document is defined by the ‘lang’ attribute in the ‘&lt;html&gt;’ tag at the root of the document. This gives us a hook that we can use in CSS to apply globally to the document.</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where we had a blog that has a language switcher between English and German. Generally German words are longer than English so we might want to set the reading length on the German version of our article to a slightly wider value.</p>

<p>The CSS might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>article {
   max-width:33em;
}
:lang(de) article {
  max-width:40em;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as the ‘lang’ attribute is changed from the default ‘en’ to ‘de’ (through a mechanism like a language select dropdown) the width of the ‘&lt;article&gt;’ changes to a wider reading length making a (potentially) easier read for our German readers.</p>

<p>You could extend this technique to tweak the rest of the layout to adapt to the changing line-length. The fact that the language attribute is at the root of the document makes for a nice and clean base to apply global rules that respond to different languages.</p>

                <p>This hilarious animated gif crafted by Tiago Franco (<a href="http://twitter.com/Alarka">@Alarka</a>) has probably been viewed by the entire web development community by now. It shows the responsive web designer&#8217;s instinctive grabbing of the browser handles whenever they open a new website. We all do it and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p><img src="https://gimmebar-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50a54eeeb0ce5.gif"/></p>

<p>It illustrates a real problem in situations where web designers and developers <strong>try to design for this eventuality</strong> - to dazzle and amaze their industry colleagues while losing sight of the project&#8217;s audience. If you are building a website (responsive or otherwise) and your project personas become industry heroes rather than those you painstakingly identified at the beginning of a project then it&#8217;s time to worry. The project is in danger of losing sight of it&#8217;s <strong>original goals</strong>, the <strong>purpose</strong> it set out to serve and the <strong>value</strong> it was supposed to deliver. I would wager that this mostly happens around the concious incompetence and concious competence stages of <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/the_responsive_dip">the responsive dip</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong - I don&#8217;t have an issue with testing layouts in this manner for the right reasons, in fact I would strongly recommend <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/ish/">stress testing your layout</a> at <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/lab/responsiveroulette">random viewport widths</a>. Try closing your eyes whilst dragging the browser handles to alter the window width, stop dragging at a random point and then open your eyes again. This removes any transitional<sup id="fnref:p36129060691-1"><a href="#fn:p36129060691-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> hocus-pocus from the changing layout and gives you an idea of the state in which real users will load your product. Real users aren&#8217;t going to see changing layouts, the chances are they will see <strong>only one layout state</strong><sup id="fnref:p36129060691-2"><a href="#fn:p36129060691-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t lose sight of who you are really building this for.</p>

                  <a class="post-link" href="/2012/10/04/the-airfix-responsive-workflow.html"><h1 class="article-header">The Airfix Responsive Workflow</h1></a>
                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>I had an epiphany recently regarding one of the biggest concerns around adopting a responsive methodology for web projects — workflow.</p>

<p>People have been stating that responsive design projects require a fundamental shift in the web design workflow we have become accustomed to from years of building fixed layouts based on flat images that try to represent a website. I believe the shift is actually relatively small, in fact you might be working this way already.</p>

<p>After a critical evaluation of my previously established workflow, I came to the same conclusion a lot of pundits have already arrived at: flat compositions just don&#8217;t work. They are as useful as a photograph of a web page, they don&#8217;t represent interactions, the infinite canvas, how typography behaves, and so on. Compositions set an unrealistic goal, a rainbow for web developers to chase to the end of a project with scattered showers of compromise and disappointment along the way.</p>

<p>I realised an additional enlightening thought: the design phase is ethereal throughout the project, an entity that <strong>permeates</strong> through the different stages of a project lifecycle. It moves, it&#8217;s supple, it <strong>adapts</strong>. Sound familiar? Allow me to walk you through my refined process for responsive projects<sup id="fnref:p32866575759-1"><a href="#fn:p32866575759-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<p>When I wireframe I usually iterate from very low fidelity sketches with initial ideas up to a medium fidelity sketch with general layout decisions, content considerations and components to document in a functional specification<sup id="fnref:p32866575759-2"><a href="#fn:p32866575759-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is where the small changes to my process begin. After annotating my wireframes to correspond with the functional specification I use an additional copy of the wireframes to label typography and modular components with <strong>reference numbers</strong>. Similar pieces can be labeled with the same colour or other categorisation techniques to help with the next step of the process.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbd43b8p0A1qcjdi5.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>The wireframe begins to resemble a <em>set of instructions</em> for an Airfix kit. Identical pieces of the wireframe that are intended to be reused are given the same reference number. The reference numbers correspond to the next part of the process which may be the biggest change depending on how you work.</p>

<h2>Style Guide</h2>

<p>The wireframe numbers correspond to components in the live HTML style guide. This is the heart of the design phase. After accounting for all pieces in the wireframe, you will be in a position to construct a complete style guide covering typography and modular components ready for use throughout the website. It serves a similar purpose to the <em>pieces</em> of an Airfix kit.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbd44rDMYj1qcjdi5.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>We are now in the ideal position to design in the browser — there will almost certainly be assets you still need a graphics package to create, I&#8217;m not dismissing their effectiveness for quickly testing colour and type combinations altogether either. Photoshop/Fireworks still serves a definitive purpose in my workflow albeit a much less significant role than before — mainly asset generation.</p>

<h2>Functional Prototype</h2>

<p>This step of the process remains unchanged. Here I build the functionality (not design, not layout) documented in the functional specification. This stage is only complete when all functionality is tested and complete.</p>

<h2>Customised Prototype</h2>

<p>The wireframes and style guide play a pivotal role in this methodology. They are schematics — instructions for assembling model using pieces from the style guide kit. The typographical components and modules in the HTML style guide are the pieces that you assemble according to the wireframes to build the model. This is where the design in the browser happens.</p>

<p>Using the wireframes as a guide for shaping the layouts in terms of <strong>proportions</strong> we can then quickly piece together detailed design layouts on top of a fully functional prototype, we can make adjustments to things that don&#8217;t work so well and quickly iterate. It&#8217;s almost like painting by numbers — it&#8217;s that easy.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t fully sold on designing in the browser until I tried this approach. By stepping into the browser sooner, you can make more informed design decisions without shooting yourself in the foot down the line. The style guide is key to the success of this approach, the more flexible the pieces are, the better they will fit into the overall model.</p>

<p>In summary, the biggest change is dropping flat compositions as a deliverable — they are a heavy piece of the process that set false expectations. Perhaps they may still be of use internally for quick visualisation purposes, but they are damaging to responsive projects if treated as a deliverable. Wireframes should be given more prominence as a set of instructions that inform both the creation of the style guide as well as informing the shape of the layout when it comes to customising a functional prototype using the style guide. The wireframes should be a conceptual model of the final product, not the definitive model. This process involves greater communication with your clients which is a good thing. The style guide is presented much like <a href="http://twitter.com/samanthatoy">Samantha Warren&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://styletil.es/">Style Tiles</a> with the message that it contains the building blocks of the complete model. Like any process, there is always room for improvement — I would love to hear your thoughts if you have any further ideas or insights from your own process. This works for me, I hope it helps you too.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t think of a more apt description of this handy little technique I am about to share with you to show you how I would approach <strong>print styles</strong> in responsive projects.</p>

<p>Print layouts are limiting. There isn&#8217;t much you can do in the sense of advanced layouts, even floats can cause problems. For print it&#8217;s a matter of <strong>reducing the visual noise</strong>, <strong>extracting the content</strong> and determining useful supplementary information.</p>

<p>Lucky for us if we are developing from a mobile first standpoint we can involve print styles at this level too so that most of our layout resets for the print media type are already taken care for us before horizontal layout occurs.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/global.css" media="all"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/layout.css" media="all and (min-width: 33.236em)"&gt;
&lt;!-- Floats and horizontal layout techniques live within layout.css where there is room, global.css contains all styles apart from horizontal layout and any adjustments for large contexts --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I’m going to generalize for a moment: mobile first <em>layouts</em> are mostly full-width blocks that contain the full set of styles (minus horizontal layout specific styles like floats and widths) with a harmonious vertical rhythm. When making a print stylesheet, we usually cancel floats, reset widths and hide the unnecessary interactive elements like navigation and video. The floats and widths (generally) aren&#8217;t set in our global stylesheet so it makes perfect sense for a print media query to live at this level, so at the <strong>bottom of your single column stylesheet</strong>, you could have:</p>

<pre><code>/* Print stub */

@media only print {
    header, footer, nav, video, .etc, .and-so-forth {
        display: none;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would change how you reference your stylesheets in HTML by changing the media type referencing your CSS file for layouts greater than a single column to this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/global.css" media="all"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/layout.css" media="screen and (min-width: 33.236em)"&gt;
&lt;!-- changed media="all and.." to media="screen and..." so when printing, the device won't look in layout.css for print styles --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For more fine grain control over the quality over printed material from your project, you can make use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#resolution">print media query values</a> to map styles to printers with certain levels of detail:</p>

<pre><code>@media print and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
    /* Styles for printers with a print resolution greater than 300 dots per inch */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Putting your print styles at the bottom of your single column stylesheet means you are only pruning the styles set at a this level before horizontal layouts occur meaning they are will be <strong>quicker to produce</strong>, <strong>easier to maintain</strong> and <strong>lightweight</strong>. Responsive web design has a knack for traversing mediums, lets take advantage of that.</p>
