              <div class="article-content">
                <p>I returned to meditation practice this morning for the first time in a long time. I felt that I’d be more experienced, know to expect a rough start and not to chase foolish goals. The mind chatter was much louder and more ridiculous than I anticipated. Here is a log of probably what is a small percentage of thoughts that appeared during the session.</p>

<p>I used Kevin Rose’s <a href="https://www.oakmeditation.com">Oak Meditation app</a> for the first time. I’ve had it on my iPhone homescreen for a quite a while as a visual reminder to return to the practice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thought about past failures with meditation and my shallow breathing making it difficult to pick a point to focus on</li>
  <li>Thought about whether the narrator was human or synthesised voice</li>
  <li>Concluded he’s human</li>
  <li>Thought about whether he is getting paid for this or whether he’s doing it out of the kindness of his heart</li>
  <li>Concluded he’s probably kind</li>
  <li>Thought about a focus point of the breath again. My nose seems to work</li>
  <li>Thought about how taking deeper breaths would work, but would be forced and the forcing of those breaths would cause light-headedness and would be a distraction in themselves</li>
  <li>Thought about failing because of busy thoughts, corrected this thought with Dan Harris’ “bicep curl for the brain” quote.</li>
  <li>Thought about trying not to think about those things and return to the breath</li>
  <li>Thought about how I can’t seem to keep a clear mind for one iteration of in-pause-out</li>
  <li>Thought about how I would know if I did</li>
  <li>Congratulated myself for getting to 3 iterations undistracted</li>
  <li>Told myself off for congratulating myself as that was a distraction from the breath</li>
  <li>Thought about yesterday’s meetings</li>
  <li>Thought about today’s to do list</li>
  <li>Decided that can wait</li>
  <li>Congratulated myself for deciding they could wait</li>
  <li>Decided to stop congratulating myself and return to the breath</li>
  <li>Thought about silence for 3-4 iterations of the breath</li>
  <li>Was thinking about silence a thought in itself?</li>
  <li>Focused intensely on the breath</li>
  <li>Thought about the words “This is all there is” that manifested from nowhere</li>
  <li>Thought about where it came from.</li>
  <li>Thought it was cool and that I should probably Tweet about that</li>
  <li>No. Return to the breath</li>
  <li>Congratulated myself for not pursuing enlightenment</li>
  <li>Decided to stop congratulating myself and return to the breath</li>
  <li>Would enlightenment be like a natural DMT trip? Or at least what my impression of what that looks like?</li>
  <li>Thought about how that might be true and how that might have shaped ancient cultures</li>
  <li>Thought about the breath</li>
  <li>Thought about the instructor’s words to “Relax and let the mind wander”… or did he mean “wonder?”</li>
  <li>Thought about observing myself from the outside</li>
  <li>Thought about where the mind sits</li>
  <li>Thought about how this session has been a disaster</li>
  <li>Thought about how long was left</li>
  <li>Thought about how it’s all a learning experience and how I couldn’t even switch those thoughts off</li>
  <li>Thought about “This is all there is” again and quickly decided this was a low point rather than some sort of miniature enlightenment</li>
  <li>Thought about returning to the breath</li>
  <li>Thought about what might happen if I return to the breath successfully and actually manage to hold it and then the session ends</li>
  <li>Thought about how I wanted the session to be a few minutes longer</li>
  <li>Thought about the room, my surroundings, my to-do list</li>
</ul>

<p>End of session.</p>
