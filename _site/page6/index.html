                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>On July 14th 2011 Trent Walton published an article introducing the concept of <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/">Content Choreography</a>. The article opened my mind and made me question some of the limitations we face in how we build responsive experiences. At the time content reordering and reflow hadn&#8217;t been widely explored beyond JavaScript-based solutions and I had been experimenting a lot with flexbox to reorder and arrange items horizontally for <a href="http://www.typecast.com">Typecast&#8217;s</a> UI. When Trent spoke about content stacking, I started to think what was achievable for reordering content along the y-axis in a single column layout.</p>

<h3>A tale of two syntaxes</h3>

<p>The flexible box model landscape has been through a series of fundamental changes since its introduction in 2009. The original syntax for declaring the property in CSS is still recognised in a lot of today&#8217;s popular browsers. The following 3 years brought two significant changes to the syntax mainly around the language used to specify flexbox properties.</p>

<p>The flexbox specification has been finalised since <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/2012/04/26/building-with-content-choreography.html">I wrote about using flexbox to tackle content choreography concerns in May 2012</a> so it&#8217;s a good time to revisit the approach. Although the new flexbox syntax has been agreed it has not been widely implemented. Since the spec was settled we have witnessed the release of new mobile operating systems like iOS 6 that boasted numerous updates to Safari - one of which <a href="http://bgr.com/2012/08/06/ios-6-beta-4-change-log-now-available/">refrained from implementing the new syntax</a> and reverted to the old 2009 syntax. At the time of writing it is unclear whether iOS 7 will feature the updated syntax. Android&#8217;s default browser still uses the old syntax although Chrome on Android uses the new syntax like its desktop counterpart. That leaves us in some sort of syntax-purgatory between the final specification and the 2009 syntax.</p>

<p>Luckily the changes between old and new flexbox won&#8217;t affect how we use it to reorder blocks of content, just how we write the code. Some repetition is required, much like writing vendor prefixes.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that flexbox <strong>is safe to use on the web today</strong> for content choreography. According to <a href="http://caniuse.com/flexbox">caniuse.com&#8217;s</a> global browser usage statistics 76.52% of users would be able to view a flexbox-based solution to content choreography at the time of writing. 23.48% might seem like a considerable amount of people, but when we break that figure down further it&#8217;s not quite so big. 23.48% takes the desktop versions of Internet Explorer into consideration and we don&#8217;t intend to use this solution that demographic.</p>

<p>Content choreography using flexbox is most reliable at the <strong>first major breakpoint</strong> (usually in a single column). It&#8217;s also easiest at this level because we are (largely) dealing with moving element blocks around vertically on the y-axis. When we approach content choreography from this angle we can <em>assume</em> most desktop browsers won&#8217;t see our reordered page. Looking again at the browser statistics for flexbox support among mobile browsers only 14.4% of users won&#8217;t see choreographed content.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t usually make decisions based on browser statistics, especially project-specific decisions, but for gauging a general sense of browser support for something previously thought of as an edge-case CSS property, I think it&#8217;s worth pointing out that it is as safe to use in this context as something trivial like the text-shadow property.</p>

<h3>A note about screenreaders</h3>

<p>Before we dive into code specifics, we need to talk about accessibility. Screen readers will not read an altered source order changed by flexbox. Instead they will read the original document order which makes for a jarring and confusing experience for users requiring a service like VoiceOver.</p>

<p>Some feel that for this reason it <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/335302203218735104">is better to make source order changes in JavaScript</a> rather than CSS although others counter that <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/335303118982103040">this hinders innovation</a> and screen readers simply must follow our lead in pushing the web forward as a platform.</p>

<p>I am firmly in favour of a CSS-based approach as this is fundamentally a layout change after the effect. Using JavaScript instead of CSS to achieve a layout goal that can otherwise be achieved in CSS feels like a Frankenstein approach. I feel it&#8217;s dragging us back to the dark ages instead of helping our platform mature. If we choose to remain stagnant on issues like this then it would be like encouraging the use of JavaScript for rollover states in 2013. The fact is we have flexbox at our disposal and specced for use in CSS, avoiding it is only going to encourage the makers of screen reading software to do the same.</p>

<h3>A solution for past, present and future</h3>

<p>Now that we have covered the fundamentals, there are a few simple considerations to account for when building with flexbox to achieve content choreography. I have found the following mindset helps:</p>

<ul><li>Start designing and building for mobile first (no-brainer)</li>
<li>Your DOM order is your <em>definitive</em> order. Build for this order first <em>before</em> addressing content choreography concerns. If you are unsure about your definitive source order, this is the DOM order shown when your layout <strong>has enough space</strong> to show everything you want to show in a sensible hierarchy. </li>
<li>This requires <strong>foresight</strong> — one of the most difficult skills in a responsive designer&#8217;s arsenal. The DOM order will act as the fallback order on devices with limited screen space and where flexbox doesn&#8217;t work (Opera Mini, Opera Mobile &lt; 12.0 etc). Use content choreography only if your layout <strong>needs</strong> it in your first breakpoint.</li>
<li>Address the past, present and future devices by using both flexbox syntaxes.</li>
</ul><p>All things considered the revised flexbox code for a definitive specification looks like something this<sup id="fnref:p53179333055-1"><a href="#fn:p53179333055-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<pre>
<code>
.container {
display: -moz-box;
display: -webkit-box;
display: -ms-flexbox;
display: -webkit-flex;
display: flex;
-moz-box-orient: vertical;
-webkit-box-orient: vertical;
-ms-flex-direction: column;
-webkit-flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column;
}

.nav {
  -webkit-box-ordinal-group: 1;
  -moz-box-ordinal-group: 1;
  -ms-flex-order: 1;
  -webkit-order: 1;
  order: 1;
}

...
</code>
</pre>

<p>I have updated the <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/lab/contentchoreography">original demo</a> so it considers the new syntax.</p>

<p>Flexbox is no longer the volatile experimental property it once was, now that we have a final specification in place and widespread support on mobile devices flexbox is a robust solution for content choreography exactly where we want it to be — where space is confined and some layout adjustment is required.</p>

                <p>When we design we generally do so in two dimensions — length and width. They are the physical constraints of what our technology is currently capable of. Our dimensional restraints are then realised on the devices used to experience our design.</p>

<p>Beyond the two dimensional screen exists the third dimension (and many other theorised dimensions) — the physical space in which our designs exist beyond the canvas. Here, all sorts of physical parameters affect how a person uses our design.</p>

<p>Consider the user&#8217;s physical space around them — perhaps they are lying on their side on the sofa or in bed and holding a mobile device with one hand. Can the design be enjoyed when a user&#8217;s is physically restricted from using two hands? Luke Wroblewski further elaborates on this idea in his <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1664">Testing One Thumb, One Eyeball article</a> detailing the test procedure for Polar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If people can get things done in time sensitive, limited dexterity situations, they&#8217;ll be even more efficient when we have their full attention and two-hands focused on our designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649">separate article</a> Luke details the reach of one thumb with the diagram below to show the considerations for positioning navigation. This is relevant to anything you want people to reach easily, for example if you had a single purpose web app, you might want to position the primary action in the safe zone just like Instagram does with their primary action (take picture).</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://static.lukew.com/tnav-touch-phones2.png" alt=""/><figcaption>Image from Luke Wroblewski&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649">Responsive Navigation: Optimizing for Touch Across Devices</a> article</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Beyond the canvas take into account where the thumb might hover while the device is in use. Sometimes people rest their thumb along the ridge of the hardware while others hover it over a portion of the screen poised to press something. This emphasises the importance of testing with real devices. Real hardware considers space in three dimensions whereas on-screen emulators put themselves into the two dimensional canvas free from physical distractions — it&#8217;s not really representative of the physical world we live in <strong>beyond the canvas</strong>.</p>

                <p>The craft of <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/combining-typefaces">combining typefaces</a> can feel like a daunting prospect. It’s easy to shy away from the adventurous cross-pollination of different typefaces and stick to families and superfamilies to achieve typographic harmony.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/d0e4b6ddc57676da428f8a1902c85b7f/tumblr_inline_mlvrw5LSyI1qz4rgp.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Thankfully <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/">Five Simple Steps</a>’ latest addition to their helpful Pocket Guides series from <a href="http://www.nicewebtype.com">Tim Brown</a> seeks to offer reassurance and open-mindedness when it comes to making typographic decisions. Tim approaches the subject from a web designer’s perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to think about compositions not as layouts, but as coordinated chunks of typeset elements that do specific jobs and exist in many states simultaneously shifting dynamically among those states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book itself is the living realisation of Tim’s own words. The methodology described within its pages is broken down into digestible chunks for quick reference and assurance. There are recurring themes of pausing, stepping back and patience. Combining typefaces is an intricate craft that is more rewarding with practice and knowledge about the faces you work with. Tim expresses the importance of absorbing the type, its purpose, its features, the relationships between spaces and rhythms at a micro and a macro level. The deeper you know about the characteristics of different typefaces and the content that the typefaces are going to represent, the easier it is to find harmony between both entities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s the bottom line: absorb the text and the author’s or client’s intentions with vigor, because it is integral to your success. If the visual decisions you make aren’t meaningfully connected to the ideas they represent, then your typeface combinations don’t matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a purposely open-ended book, because with design there are few definitives. The skill of combining typefaces is nourished with learning from, documenting and critiquing work. A few years ago I naively believed there were certain formulas for this practice. After reading Tim’s words I am excited about looking at typography through a more meaningful lens. Combining Typefaces is valuable addition to any web designer’s desk — one that I’ll be keeping within reach.</p>

                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>Earlier today Roger Johansson posted an article about potential scenarios for <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201303/letting_users_disable_responsive_layout/">disabling a responsive design</a> along with <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/disable-responsive-layout/">a demo</a>. As noted in the article, this isn&#8217;t new thinking as both <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2013/turning-off-responsive-web-design/">Bruce Lawson</a>, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/user-opt-out-responsive-design/">Chris Coyier</a> and various others have spoken about it before — the purpose was to introduce the demo along with scenarios where it would be useful.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t figure out what my stance is on the approach. I&#8217;m leaning more towards thinking that this is a good idea. Some view the inclusion of an off-switch as an admission of failure in the implementation of a responsive design — I&#8217;m not so sure it is. <a href="http://chris-armstrong.com/">Chris Armstrong</a> put it nicely on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RWD involves making assumptions on the user&#8217;s behalf, why not allow them to be overriden?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish I had a toggle for the bad responsive designs, the ones that &#8220;don&#8217;t get it&#8221; (i.e they hide content and bastardise the experience rather than adapt it appropriately). Even if we have examined and tested our assumptions thoroughly, there is always a chance that we&#8217;ll get something wrong and I think users deserve a chance to undo something we impose on them (with good intent).</p>

<p>Roger&#8217;s article discusses the language around the toggle switch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trickiest part is probably what to call the switch. Phrases like “View desktop layout”, “Go to desktop version” and “View full site” seem like saying that what you’re currently viewing is missing something. So instead I called it “View fixed width layout” (and “View flexible width layout” to toggle back). I don’t really know if it helps end users understand the difference, but I think it’s a more accurate description than using “desktop” and “mobile”. Someone’s browser window being narrower than 960 pixels, or 1200 pixels, or wherever you choose to draw the line, does not necessarily mean they’re using a “mobile” device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After years of m-dot websites users have been conditioned to feel that &#8220;View desktop site&#8221; means that the page is hiding something from them. That&#8217;s why I think trying to add language to the switch won&#8217;t work, it may create the feeling of deception that exists with many m-dot sites. Also using terms like &#8220;fluid&#8221; and &#8220;fixed&#8221; will mean <strong>nothing</strong> to the average user. The language would need to feel familiar and create an expectation — although in this situation, the user&#8217;s expectation is that the button will reveal a &#8220;full version&#8221; revealing the stuff that the page is hiding.</p>

<p>I think we could do something visually rather than give it confusing and misguided terms. I&#8217;m not saying this suggestion is the definitive approach, it&#8217;s more of a rough idea. The image below gives you an idea of what an icon might look like before and after it is toggled.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/b2f8ea92bc83bb949336d808e5cf0c06/tumblr_inline_mk8mcutqUY1qz4rgp.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The left icon shows what it might look like in a standard responsive layout with the option to toggle a fixed width layout, the right shows how it would look from the fixed width layout if the user wanted to switch back to a responsive layout.</p>

<p>Again — this is just a rough idea using a couple of <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/928458-80-Shades-of-White-Icons">repurposed icons</a>, if you do decide to implement an off switch, then I suggest trying a visual reference rather than potentially confusing wording.</p>

                <p>When designing for small screens keep in mind that everything you do is under the microscope - design patterns, interactions, usability, speed — everything. These wonderful little devices that we cup in our hands offer a small, personal and intimate window in which to enjoy the web.</p>

<p>It is more important than ever that we get the little details right. A small screen space is limited in what we can show at any particular moment - and that&#8217;s what we are dealing with here, lots of tiny <strong>moments</strong>. By contrast a large screen offers plenty of room for design problems to hide or go mostly unnoticed. Small displays don&#8217;t allow that. They are unforgiving to poor design decisions which is why a lot of designers are quick to scrutinise and attack a poorly implemented responsive design. This type of scrutiny is more often than not about the design and technical aspects whereas users scrutinise with a different lens which generally concerns more important aspects content and value.</p>

<p>I suggest looking at a confined layout as a series of moments. Ask difficult questions of it: <em>"Does this moment achieve what I want it to achieve?"</em>, <em>"Does this particular moment offer any value?</em>&#8221;, <em>"Does this moment facilitate or distract from the overall message/objective/goal?"</em>, <em>"Does this moment make sense independently or does it require the bigger picture to give it context?"</em></p>

<p>Our design decisions are magnified in this personal space. It&#8217;s a rewarding space that can offer intimacy and undivided attention - small screens deserve good experiences and a responsive approach<sup id="fnref:p45185035075-1"><a href="#fn:p45185035075-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> can allow that good experience to permeate any device or dynamic that it is faced with.</p>
