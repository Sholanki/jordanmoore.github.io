          <p>I am delighted to announce that after 7 years working in web agencies I have decided to leave and start a new adventure as a freelance web designer.</p>

<p>Since I joined Front in 2008 midway through my final year of university, I have spent the last 7 years honing my craft specialising in <strong>responsive web design</strong>, <strong>user experience</strong> as well as <strong>front end</strong> and <strong>Expression Engine development</strong>. I believe that being part of the team with Front (now known as Typecast) and Eyekiller has equipped me with the skills required to manage my own destiny and seek new and exciting projects.</p>

<p>Working and collaborating closely with clients of all different shapes and sizes from various sectors including the BBC, Firefly and TextHelp and has been a truly invaluable experience. Iâ€™ll miss working with my fantastic clients - it has been a priviledge working together with <strong>each and every one of you</strong> to make useful, meaningful things for the web.</p>

<p>And of course I will miss working alongside the wonderful team at Eyekiller. I have made many friends since I joined in 2012. My last day is just under a month away on April 1st 2015. If you have any projects you would like to discuss with me, please feel free to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#097;&#100;&#101;&#098;&#121;&#106;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">get in touch</a>!</p>
