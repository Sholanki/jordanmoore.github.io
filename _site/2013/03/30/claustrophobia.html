    <p>I have spent the majority of this week wrestling with my conscience over the concept of allowing a user to switch a responsive design off. After a few healthy discussions and debates I&#8217;m still leaning towards thinking it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>

<p>Even though we put our efforts into meticulously designing a good experience that scales across major breakpoints, a user on a small screen is stuck there with whatever breakpoint they get — and there&#8217;s nothing they can do about it. If this happened on a large screen in you could easily remedy the situation by resizing the browser window until you find something more comfortable for whatever reason<sup id="fnref:p46657852980-1"><a href="#fn:p46657852980-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is my overriding concern — there&#8217;s no way out. There&#8217;s no way out of a bad design, an incompatible plugin, a browser bug, missing content, the endless list of potential issues someone could potentially encounter with a website whether it is responsive or not.</p>

<p>Our intention should always be to provide the best experience<sup id="fnref:p46657852980-2"><a href="#fn:p46657852980-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. We always say that mobile experiences should receive the same content as their desktop counterparts, I personally feel that we should offer them the same freedom of being able to break out of the breakpoint if the user finds it necessary.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://mistermorris.tumblr.com/post/19679735499/a-responsive-panacea">Alex Morris</a> put it just over a year ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…with responsive it’s a one way street. You can’t opt out of the media query that’s driving this thing. And that really sucks, so you better be pretty sure you can pull this thing off sonny Jim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People have told me things like &#8220;just don&#8217;t do bad design&#8221; — come on, that&#8217;s a no brainer. Nobody goes out to intentionally do bad design, and that&#8217;s certainly not the way to approach the toggling concept as if it is some sort of safety net. Bad design will happen anyway, user tested or not — you can&#8217;t test everyone in the world.</p>

<p>The other voice is telling me that this is all wrong (the little guy dressed in white with the halo — or my internet friend <a href="http://alwaystwisted.com/post.php?s=2013-03-28-toggling-bad-design">Stuart Robson</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I (unsurprisingly) think this is a cop-out. If you think that we should be giving the site visitor the option to turn off your device agnostic design so they get a desktop view. You&#8217;ve not done your job correctly in the first place.</p>
  
  <p>As Jordan says he wants to turn off RWD on bad sites. Understandable as this is it should be something mitigated at the browser level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with what Stuart says about mitigating this to the browser, it is  a browser problem. <strong>The browser is at fault. Responsive web design as a methodology isn&#8217;t at fault</strong>. Ideally this would be an issue solved at the browser level, but so would a lot of other things like responsive images — the onus is on us to take the initiative. It&#8217;s not going to happen if we simply wait for it to happen.</p>

<p>Maybe we should have this covered with our perfect designs, and it&#8217;s ok to leave the small screen user stuck in the experience we have tailored for them, but there&#8217;s just something about it that makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, a bit claustrophobic. I&#8217;m not suggesting we have an obtrusive switch that welcomes the user on entry, or that sits in view 100% of the time. Something that&#8217;s quiet, icon-based<sup id="fnref:p46657852980-3"><a href="#fn:p46657852980-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, that sits out of the way in the footer that doesn&#8217;t encourage the user to think &#8220;this isn&#8217;t the <em>full</em> view, come to the land of <em>full view</em> where everything is unhidden!&#8221;</p>

<p>Realistically, this action will affect a small portion of users. <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/">Roger Johansson</a> (who got me thinking about this in the first place) has implemented this before and <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerjohansson/status/289793560604184576">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stats I’ve seen show that very, very few use the switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s encouraging to hear, the <em>last</em> thing I want is to lead users into a mass exodus from a responsive design I have put so much thought and effort into. I just think if it helps the odd user out in doing something they happen to find more comfortable in a pinch and zoom environment <em>for whatever reason</em>  then we should probably do it rather than prevent them from doing it.</p>

<p>"For whatever reason" seems a good mantra when thinking about the users here. I would wager that if you design a good responsive implementation most people will prefer the responsive default anyway.<a href="http://surfthedream.com.au/">Justin Avery</a> made <a href="https://twitter.com/justinavery/status/316856621332582400">an excellent point</a> relating to this (even though he opposes the idea of a switch) saying that after the user makes the switch they will get the same content in a less than optimal view. <a href="#fnref:p46657852980-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
