    <p>Until recently I would have insisted that web design <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a craft. Perhaps I felt terms like &#8220;handmade&#8221; and &#8220;handcrafted&#8221; were inappropriately used as an afterthought to add the suggestion of value to a product or service. Therefore I dismissed the notion of making things for the web having any association with craft.</p>

<p>When you think of craft, immediately you think of something made with materials from natural elements like wood and stone. We imagine forging an object, something useful, built to last and beautifully simple.</p>

<p>When I look at handmade goods, I am usually met with several impressions — if the goods are handmade then there mustn&#8217;t be that many in existence therefore each one is unique and holds a certain degree of value; if the goods are handmade then that must mean a human has inspected the process of making the item, not a pre-programmed machine, therefore the build quality is better.</p>

<p>Both situations can apply to and justify web design as a craft. Just because we don&#8217;t work with tangible materials of the earth doesn&#8217;t mean we aren&#8217;t making something useful, beautiful and built to last. Our raw materials are elements like typography and colour.</p>

<p>The build quality of our digital goods ultimately define us as craftsmen and craftswomen of the web. Machine code and templates are often easily distinguishable from that of code built from scratch, adjusted, refined and tested by human hands. Keyboards and mouses aren&#8217;t our real tools — they are simply the physical link between our hands and the digital tools we use to produce digital goods.</p>
