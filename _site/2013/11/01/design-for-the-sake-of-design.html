  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Until recently this very blog you are reading sported a dashing, large, full-width image atop each article. It took a considerable amount of time to trawl through all of my previous articles and match them with a suitable image so each article adhered to the new template design.</p>

<p>Then I got rid of them.</p>

<p>The images occupied over 600 pixels at the top of my articles before you even got close to the content. The content that held the <em>real</em> value sat below this unnecessary distraction — an obstruction. They added little to no real value to my writing — under scrutiny the trend-conforming strip might as well have been a decoration — design for the sake of design.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3y3F1M1R0H2O08450I09/dribbble.jpg"/><figcaption>
Dribbble is great for measuring design trends. A search for &#8220;home page&#8221; returns a lot of similar looking layouts</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The vast majority of Medium posts contain similar page headings. I don&#8217;t like picking on Medium<sup id="fnref:p65682063930-1"><a href="#fn:p65682063930-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> because it&#8217;s an easy target — it&#8217;s successful, lots of people use it, lots of people read it and lots of people who use it feel cheated when people don&#8217;t read their work on it, and lots of people write anti-Medium posts complaining about the conundrum.</p>

<p>Medium&#8217;s gorgeous editor begins with asking if you want to add an optional header image. I&#8217;d wager most people fill this space because they feel they have to, that it would look un-Medium-like, or that it might scupper their chances of having their post featured. The problem is where the headers are populated for the sake of putting <em>something</em> there, the overall value of the post suffers. Sometimes the connection between the content and the image is so vague it goes unnoticed or sometimes it&#8217;s just plain irrelevant<sup id="fnref:p65682063930-2"><a href="#fn:p65682063930-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I think large header images are useless — in fact, when they are done well with relevant content they are like book or magazine covers for the web — a preface to the content. When the content of the image is tangibly linked to the content throughout the page, they compliment each other and the page reads like a single harmonious piece.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3T3J0p2N2Y113825000y/tgd.jpg"/><figcaption><a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/">The Great Discontent</a> is the perfect example of using this space to add value through beautiful, relevant imagery that sets the tone for the article</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>This layout works best when used within constraints — in the Great Discontent&#8217;s case, their stunning header images feature interviewees and act as a high quality magazine cover that adds value to the overall piece. It is clear that the content comes first and considered decisions were made afterwards to produce a beautiful record of industry interviews.</p>

<p>The problem that a lot of the websites that attempt to emulate this layout face is when the template dictates the shape of the content and it becomes a game of shape sorting. I&#8217;d go as far as to say that it harms the user experience when they are asked to scroll past a pointless piece of content with no intrinsic value — in such circumstances, the image might as well be a banner ad. The effort involved with scrolling past a meaningless piece of imagery before the content is released to you is akin to the behaviour of parallax scrolling websites where you are made to feel like a hamster in a wheel powering a lightbulb with your scrolling rhythm.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not difficult to spot the difference between those who are simply conforming to a style and those who put value before aesthetic.</p>
