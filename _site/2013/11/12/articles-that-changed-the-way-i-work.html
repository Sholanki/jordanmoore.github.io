    <p>Our Twitter streams and RSS feeds are flooded with valuable new articles every day. Some I get time to read, some I don&#8217;t, some of the ideas within stick and some ideas simply don&#8217;t â€” that&#8217;s just the way it is with writing on the web as with any advice in life.</p>

<p>Here are the articles that have stuck with me and influence how I make things for the web:</p>

<h3>Mindset</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/dao/">A Dao of Web Design</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/johnallsopp">John Allsopp</a> (2000)</p>

<p><em>It goes without saying that this article should be on any web designer&#8217;s list. It&#8217;s 13 years old but it&#8217;s just as relevant to today&#8217;s web.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/beep">Ethan Marcotte</a> (2010)</p>

<p><em>Ethan Marcotte started a shift in design thinking that I feel is on par in terms of scope with the web standards movement. This turned my approach to web design on its head and encouraged me to look at things from a new perspective much in line with John Allsopp&#8217;s vision of the web.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">Mobile First</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/lukew">Luke Wroblewski</a></p>

<p><em>Designing and building for mobile first keeps my design decisions in check ensuring they are focused and that anything I add to a page holds value and isn&#8217;t there for superfluous reasons.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/there_is_no_breakpoint">There Is No Breakpoint</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/bencallahan">Ben Callahan</a> (2013)</p>

<p><em>In the absence of element-based media queries, Ben&#8217;s approach to responsive web design is one that I have also adopted. I couldn&#8217;t go back to forcing all my design decisions into a handful of media queries.</em></p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm/">Compose to a Vertical Rhythm</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/clagnut">Richard Rutter</a> (2006)</p>

<p><em>Richard&#8217;s timeless piece on vertical rhythm is as relevant today as ever. In small screens your vertical rhythm is exposed and under the microscope more than any other device.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/17079380">More Perfect Typography</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/nicewebtype">Tim Brown</a> (2011)</p>

<p><em>Okay it&#8217;s not an article but I simply couldn&#8217;t leave this out. I was lucky enough to be in the audience when this talk was delivered. Any decisions I make regarding typography and spacing is informed by the takeaways from Tim&#8217;s talk.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://trentwalton.com/2012/06/19/fluid-type/">Fluid Type</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/trentwalton">Trent Walton</a> (2012)</p>

<p><em>This wonderful piece by Trent Walton taught me about the importance of typographical fluidity as well as how to maintain it regardless of screen size.</em></p>

<h3>Colour Theory</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">Never Use Black</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ianstormtaylor">Ian Storm Taylor</a> (2012)</p>

<p><em>Because using #000 would feel wrong now.</em></p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/made-to-measure/">Made to Measure</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/tealtan">Allen Tan</a> (2012)</p>

<p><em>If you ever intend on working with a CMS, you need to read this. It covers editorial design, responsive design and content strategy all in one rousing article.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/">Content Choreography</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/trentwalton">Trent Walton</a> (2011)</p>

<p><em>This article changed my thinking about layout and content composition and how things should fold, rearrange and realign when the design has to break.</em></p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/brad_frost">Brad Frost</a> (2013)</p>

<p><em>Brad&#8217;s analogy of breaking down the components we have at our disposal and knowing them at an atomic level ultimately leads to a greater understanding of their usefulness.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/of-bears-bats-and-bees-making-sense-of-the-internet-of-things.html">Of Bears, Bats and Bees: Making Sense of the Internet of Things</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/scottjenson">Scott Jensen</a> (2012)</p>

<p><em>For understanding where we look at our products in a philosophical sense on the web.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/hybrid_alex">Alex Carpenter</a> has put together a handy <a href="http://d.pr/f/iLLP">Kindle bundle</a> of all the above articles.</p>

        <p>Owning a set of mobile devices for testing has its benefits, but not necessarily for finding layout bugs. A varied set of screen densities however is invaluable for testing readability.</p>
