    <p>Our tools are antisocial. They don&#8217;t talk to each other very much, or very well, or <em>at all</em> most of the time. One tool does the editing, one does the uploading and another lets you see the result on the web. Some tools are negotiators, like CodeKit. They try to help everyone get along by becoming the invisible glue holding the whole operation together.</p>

<p>I can live with some of this friction. I feel it most between browser and code editor though. Considering the code editor makes the stuff you see in the browser it&#8217;s funny how they barely speak to each other if at all in most cases.</p>

<p>What if <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a><sup id="fnref:p67849895677-1"><a href="#fn:p67849895677-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> had a detachable browser window docked on the side? Not only could that being browser and editor closer by visual proximity but imagine if it unlocked new capabilities that allowed them to talk to each other&#8230;</p>

<h3>Realtime design in the browser</h3>

<p>Style injections that allow you to see instant results and automatic page reloading for markup changes is one of the biggest time savers an application such as this could offer. We have already patched this behaviour with our negotiators like LiveReload and CodeKit, but if it worked straight out of the box with a hybrid browser and editor tool it would reload more reliably (i.e <strong>after</strong> CSS is preprocessed — I have had frustrating run-ins with compilers that can jump the gun).</p>

<p>I believe any CSS changes should be immediately reflected in the docked browser window without the need for saving the file in a way that doesn&#8217;t destruct the page — that would require a bit of intelligent logic when creating new style rules in the middle of a Stylesheet to assume a closing brace.</p>

<p>It should preprocess LESS and Sass files too and while we’re theorising — it should have the capability of doing that beyond the local environment (e.g over FTP).</p>

<p>This is an area our negotiators have mostly covered so it&#8217;s not the biggest pain point of web development.</p>

<h3>Inspect Element in Editor</h3>

<p>Right clicking in the browser and inspecting element should bring you to the appropriate line in CSS <em>inside the editor itself</em>.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is one of the biggest problems in web development workflows. The current behaviour allows you to inspect and make adjustments in the browser. While this is a good thing the boost in productivity is lost when you have to retrace your steps, copy and paste your code, save, reload, realise you didn&#8217;t retrieve all of your inspector changes, despair, recreate them again in the browser, meticulously retrieve your changes this time causing your workflow to slow to a snails pace and watch the perceived benefits of in-browser editing vaporise before your eyes, copy and paste your code into your editor, save, hesitate, hesitate a little more, then decide to open a new browser tab and leave the tab containing your ideal design state the hell alone, load the URL, and hope that it works.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t how it should be.</p>

<p>By bringing browser and editor together, the disconnect between both entities is non-existent and the issue with the workflow above is vanquished. No more copying and pasting and retrieving edits lost in code.</p>

<p>There are a couple of potential limitations: why favour CSS over DOM inspection when inspecting elements? I don&#8217;t necessarily think it should. Perhaps when an editor tab is open containing markup, inspect element should find the selected element in the markup and a shortcut key could help you cycle through other areas that it affects in CSS. This shortcut would also help solve the problem of navigating multiple CSS rules. Sublime Text’s minimap could become a temporary space during source inspection to show the affected areas in CSS and HTML, line numbers, file names and provide a visual shortcut to where we might want to go. Maybe even some quick edit abilities like Adobe Brackets would be useful in this space.</p>

<h3>Milestones</h3>

<p>You’d think live editing would bring big changes to how we save work - it shouldn&#8217;t. Live edits, like editing in browser inspection tools, are only committed to code when saved in the editor. So if you change a page through the live editor and close without saving, your changes wouldn&#8217;t appear next time you loaded the project - which is exactly the way it should be.</p>

<p>One of my other gripes about current web development tools is that it&#8217;s difficult to roll back to a safe state. If you are working on a project and you make some heavy changes that mess up the code and design it&#8217;s a Cmd-Z marathon to find the last safe and stable state.</p>

<p>Milestones would help solve this problem. It&#8217;s a feature already present in <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a> and it&#8217;s super-useful. Before making major changes you could press a different hotkey instead of Cmd-S to save a milestone. You could optionally name the milestone and continue to make the major code changes knowing there is a saved state you could quickly roll back to if it all goes wrong.</p>

<h3>Browsers</h3>

<p>For the browser element of this editor to be a true web design tool, it should allow you to switch between Trident, Gecko and Webkit<sup id="fnref:p67849895677-2"><a href="#fn:p67849895677-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> rendering engines. The context menu shouldn&#8217;t change in each rendering engine, you should be allowed to inspect element and see the affected code in each browser to quickly diagnose layout issues and make changes in the code editor.</p>

<p>There have been attempts by integrated development environments to accomplish some of the concepts above, but no existing solution has truly met each pain point satisfyingly. I&#8217;m not a programmer so I don&#8217;t know how feasible it is to accomplish each point, all I know is as a front end developer at the coalface these problems begin to grate on you after a while and it needs fixed.</p>

<p>AKA Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. I think that they should keep their rendering engine name so people know the technology behind the branded browsers as well as to cover potential issues that browser vendors might have building their browser into a hybrid browser and code editor. <a href="#fnref:p67849895677-2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
