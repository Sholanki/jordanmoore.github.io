    <p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is great for a number of reasons. It helps people unfamiliar with HTML write in a way that will render as valid, structured HTML with the appropriate tools behind the scenes that the writer doesn&#8217;t need to worry about.</p>

<p>Another thing it&#8217;s great for is <strong>formatting in the absence of visual formatting</strong>. You&#8217;ll notice this in plain text editors like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or in content management systems that lack WYSIWYG formatting tools. We have been spoilt recently with applications that give us the best of both worlds — tools like <a href="http://www.iawriter.com">iA Writer</a> and <a href="http://www.geteditorially.com">Editorially</a> that allow us to see an inline preview of the Markdown-formatted text as well as maintaining the Markdown syntax.</p>

<p>I have a scenario where Markdown is a huge help in the absence of formatting — <strong>handwritten notes</strong>. It&#8217;s something I have been playing with for the last few months, and unsurprisingly it works very well.</p>

<p>The problem with handwritten notes is that formatting is substituted for spacing which sometimes isn&#8217;t enough to clearly read a handwritten document with sections and headings. Before I started using Markdown to take analogue notes, I would have trouble differentiating between a heading or a very short, isolated paragraph.</p>

 - 

<p>Markdown thrives in plain-text environments where it is the only visual reference for formatting which makes it ideal for pen and paper. By using hashes for headings, it provides a quick visual clue for section breaks on paper.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also useful for emphasising text. I used other techniques in the past like retracing the letters (can be messy and time-consuming) and underlining text (can lead to accidental line-throughs when writing quickly), but Markdown&#8217;s asterisk-wrapping is quick and easy to write and provides a great visual anchor when scanning notes.</p>

<p>If you find yourself struggling to create a visual hierarchy in handwritten notes I suggest giving Markdown a try. Where formatting is absent Markdown excels at providing you with a great formatting framework for helpful visual reference points.</p>
