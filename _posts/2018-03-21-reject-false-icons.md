summary: Without content you are just making shapes on a screen. Decoration for decoration’s sake. A design without content is, at best, a guess. It’s a guess at how it should look and how it should feel.

Design galleries and portfolio showcase platforms are poisonous to designers in the same way that Instagram perpetuates an idyllic picture of everyday life to impressionable young teenagers. Certain services show designs for fake products with no context of requirements — and in many cases the designer is making up the requirements for the benefit of making themselves look good rather than meeting the needs of real-world users.

Nobody gets good feedback on these platforms. Bad feedback means no room for growth.

It’s much more beneficial to invest time in **thinking for yourself** and solving **your own** problems rather than someone else’s false scenario.
