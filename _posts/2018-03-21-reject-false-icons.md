summary: Without content you are just making shapes on a screen. Decoration for decoration’s sake. A design without content is, at best, a guess. It’s a guess at how it should look and how it should feel.

Design galleries and portfolio showcase platforms are poisonous to designers in the same way that Instagram perpetuates an idyllic picture of everyday life to impressionable young teenagers.

Certain services show designs for fake products with no context of requirements — and in many cases the designer is making up the requirements for the benefit of making themselves look good rather than meeting the needs of real-world users. Design showcases stripped of context of intended application is our Muscle Beach region of the Web. A place for posturing, flexing visual design muscles rather than the thinking that got you there. That's the mystery behind the facade that contains the real useful knowledge and sharing that with impressionable designers is more ethical than a display of cheap tricks.

Nobody gets good feedback on these platforms. They only encourage bad feedback through reciprocal altruism leaving no room for growth or meaningful conversation. We have a lot to learn from Quora's model where good, detailed feedback rises to the top.

Parting thought: it’s more beneficial to invest time in **thinking for yourself** and solving **your own** problems rather than someone else’s false scenario.
