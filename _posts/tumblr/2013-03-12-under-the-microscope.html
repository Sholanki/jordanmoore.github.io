summary: When designing for small screens keep in mind that everything you do is under the microscope - design patterns, interactions, usability, speed — everything. These wonderful little devices that we cup in our hands offer a small, personal and intimate window in which to enjoy the web.

<p>When designing for small screens keep in mind that everything you do is under the microscope - design patterns, interactions, usability, speed — everything. These wonderful little devices that we cup in our hands offer a small, personal and intimate window in which to enjoy the web.</p>

<p>It is more important than ever that we get the little details right. A small screen space is limited in what we can show at any particular moment - and that&#8217;s what we are dealing with here, lots of tiny <strong>moments</strong>. By contrast a large screen offers plenty of room for design problems to hide or go mostly unnoticed. Small displays don&#8217;t allow that. They are unforgiving to poor design decisions which is why a lot of designers are quick to scrutinise and attack a poorly implemented responsive design. This type of scrutiny is more often than not about the design and technical aspects whereas users scrutinise with a different lens which generally concerns more important aspects content and value.</p>

<p>I suggest looking at a confined layout as a series of moments. Ask difficult questions of it: <em>"Does this moment achieve what I want it to achieve?"</em>, <em>"Does this particular moment offer any value?</em>&#8221;, <em>"Does this moment facilitate or distract from the overall message/objective/goal?"</em>, <em>"Does this moment make sense independently or does it require the bigger picture to give it context?"</em></p>

<p>Our design decisions are magnified in this personal space. It&#8217;s a rewarding space that can offer intimacy and undivided attention - small screens deserve good experiences and a responsive approach<sup id="fnref:p45185035075-1"><a href="#fn:p45185035075-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> can allow that good experience to permeate any device or dynamic that it is faced with.</p>
