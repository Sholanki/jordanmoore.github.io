summary: I have been using <a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">xScope</a> for about 6 months, and I&#8217;m quite late to the party. It has been around for years and has long been the web developer&#8217;s Swiss Army Knife. It is a suite of tools that help make designing for the web a lot easier.

<p>I have been using <a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">xScope</a> for about 6 months, and I&#8217;m quite late to the party. It has been around for years and has long been the web developer&#8217;s Swiss Army Knife. It is a suite of tools that help make designing for the web a lot easier.</p>

<p>xScope was made and maintained by the <a href="http://iconfactory.com/">Iconfactory</a> (the guys responsible for <a href="http://twitterrific.com/">Twitteriffic</a>) and will cost you $29.99 (or £20.99).</p>

<p>xScope comes with 8 powerful tools that float above all your open windows and they really help you smooth out the rough edges of your designs:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Ruler</strong> — A pixel ruler with callipers for precise measurements of anything you choose to measure on your screen. It can be rotated, nudged with the arrow keys and resized either in jumps of 10 pixels or 1 pixel depending on the hotkey combination</li>
<li><strong>Dimensions</strong> — This is a really clever tool for quickly finding the dimensions of the currently hovered element on your screen. It seems to have some smart algorithm to figure out the measurements of things like windows, web page elements - even the leading between paragraphs of text.</li>
<li><strong>Screens</strong> — A pretty neat overlay that mimics the dimensions of popular device sizes including where things like mobile Safari toolbars will cover your design.</li>
<li><strong>Loupe</strong> — A magnified colour picker with precision options like a crosshair and gridlines to ensure you are picking the right colour.</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong> — Like the guides from your favourite graphics editing application, only on your desktop.</li>
<li><strong>Frames</strong> — This is something I haven&#8217;t explored too much. The Frames tools allows you to draw boxes over your screen and take screenshots within those boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Crosshair</strong> — A tool that gives you a precise x and y axis reading in pixels in relation to the entire screen rather than the Dimensions tool&#8217;s local measurement.</li>
<li><strong>Mirror</strong> — A tool that helps you view your designs quickly on iOS devices.</li>
</ul><p><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7366/10715559933_b89571ef56_o.jpg"/><figcaption>I keep my most frequently used tools (Dimensions, Ruler, Loupe and Guides) in the menu bar</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>xScope genuinely makes my web development easier. I don&#8217;t use all of the tools, but the ones I do use help immensely. Take Guides for example — possibly my most frequently used tool — I can draw multiple guides over my screen to check things like horizontal and vertical alignment and adjust values in the browser to try and align elements to the guides. The Guides tool comes with additional features like displaying the distance in pixels between two guides along the same axis.</p>

<p>I keep the Ruler close to hand too for measuring elements — although sometimes I&#8217;ll alternate between the Ruler and the Dimensions tool to achieve the same goal. Dimensions gets the result quicker because it&#8217;s automated, but sometimes I just like manually measuring with the Ruler for things like the spacing between elements.</p>

<p>The Loupe tool is a powerful colour picker. It helps make super precise selections by showing you a zoomed preview window equipped with optional grid and centerlines. The Loupe can also save the current selection to your clipboard for pasting into your favourite text editor or graphics editing package.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5536/10715560053_40ebd8e89e_o.jpg"/><figcaption>The Loupe is one of the most powerful tools in xScope. It comes with an array of useful options for capturing colours and saving them to your clipboard</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The Mirror tool is pretty useful too. You need to install the universal <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xscope-mirror/id488819289?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4G7&amp;ct=XSCOPE_SITE_MIRROR">companion app</a> for iOS which is only $1.99 — a small price to pay for the wealth of extra features it unlocks. You can do things like view a file on your iOS device, view a portion of your screen remotely, or lock a window on your iOS screen. I use this mostly for testing responsive designs on retina displays — it takes a while to resize my Google Chrome window to the exact dimensions of the iPad, then lock it in xScope Mirror on iOS, but once that&#8217;s done then I am free to develop and preview changes.</p>

<p>In essence the xScope Mirror app is a replacement for previewing design assets on mobile displays — some like to use techniques like saving files to Dropbox so they can open on their device — this is simply a lot quicker, it&#8217;s $1.99 for a vast improvement to your workflow.</p>

<p>There aren&#8217;t many notable drawbacks to xScope, nothing that should stop you from buying it. I noticed that over multiple monitors some of the tools get a bit buggy, for instance if I connect my MacBook Air to an external monitor, I can only ever seem to summon the Guides tool on my MacBook Air. I suspect this is a new issue since Mavericks was released. Also one or two of the tools seem a bit unnecessary — I&#8217;ve barely used Frames properly yet because it seems like watered down Screens tool (albeit an adjustable one), and I have yet to find a use for the Crosshair tool. These minor quibbles can&#8217;t diminish the fact that this is truly an essential app.</p>

<p>xScope is <a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">free to try</a> and you should if you haven&#8217;t used it before. Like a good Swiss Army Knife, you will become comfortable with the indispensable tools in the set quickly and keep them ready for use when you need them, the other tools may not get as much use, but they&#8217;ll be ready when you need them too.</p>
