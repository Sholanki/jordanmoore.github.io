<p>With the holiday season drawing ever closer, I thought I&#8217;d revisit a theme from last year and pull together some Christmas gift ideas for folks in the web industry.</p>


<p>It can be tricky finding a suitable gift that will be of genuine use to the recipient — whether it&#8217;s a co-worker, a relative or maybe you&#8217;re looking for a meaningful gift that will benefit someone who works in the web or is looking to break into the industry. I&#8217;ve tried to strike a good balance between the obvious, the eclectic, gifts for pros and gifts for beginners. Happy holidays!</p>

<hr><h3>Tilde by Jessica Hische (from $20 per year)</h3>

<p><figure><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8608/15664299767_0a4331fb5f_c.jpg"/><figcaption>Jessica&#8217;s attention to detail is evident in those beautiful in-between details</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>A stunning new typeface that looks effortless but is full of gorgeous subtle flourishes in its ligatures and strokes. It comes in two sizes for small and large uses helping maintain its delicate quality wherever you use it.</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://tilda.fontbureau.com">Webtype</a></p>

<hr><h3>Sketch 3 ($99)</h3>

<p>2014 has been the year of Sketch. Most folks I know have ditched other graphics editors in favour of Bohemian Coding&#8217;s contender. Sketch is great for easily exporting resolution independent assets, constructing styleguides, establishing typographic systems - you name it.</p>

<p>The infinite canvas approach helps keep your broad vision for your project in check — and the ability to create symbols will save you heaps of time if you need to adjust shared elements across a number of layouts.</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Bohemian Coding</a></p>

<hr><h3>Kano ($149)</h3>

<p><figure><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7541/15662728718_e06c94a220_c.jpg"/><figcaption>Creativity out of the box — build the hardware, build the software — Kano is a great learning tool</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>After watching Alex Klein speak at <a href="http://breakconf.org">Break Conference</a> in Belfast earlier this month I was completely astounded by what his company achieved with the Kano project. It started life as a humble Raspberry Pi and became a set of easy-to-assemble components that slot together to make a computer that teaches you how to code. The best part is - it&#8217;s great for kids and adults alike.</p>

<hr><h3>Responsible Responsive Design by Scott Jehl (from $9)</h3>

<p>Scott Jehl&#8217;s new book is a great addition to the A Book Apart library. He takes a look at the next level of responsive design as a practice: speed, overcoming performance issues on troublesome networks and delivering appropriate assets across the vast array of different platforms and conditions we face.</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/">A Book Apart</a></p>

<hr><h3>Responsive Sketch Pad ($16)</h3>

<p><figure><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7523/15230413133_93895d195f_b.jpg"/><figcaption>I try not to take the &#8220;screens&#8221; too seriously – the boxed areas are enough for me to figure out how elements work in a given space</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>I use my Responsive Sketch Pad pretty much every day. Its great for quickly drawing components in a narrow column and figuring out how they translate to larger spaces. Apparently it works well with UI Stencil&#8217;s pixel ruler — I didn&#8217;t realise such a thing existed!</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://www.uistencils.com/products/responsive-sketch-pad">UI Stencils</a></p>

<hr><h3>Invision App (Free with paid plans starting from $15 per month)</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ll have to confess that I have only started using Invision App picked up recently, but already the benefits are obvious and it feels like the missing link that holds the whole design and development process together.</p>

<p>From keeping designers and developers singing from the same hymnsheet, to fostering design feedback discussion and iterations — Invision has you covered.</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com">Invision</a></p>

<hr><h3>Typecast (from $19 per month)</h3>

<p>Typecast is <em>the</em> best tool for creating beautiful and usable typography for the web. It saves scouring the many different web font services available by bringing them together in a unified font selection UI. Typecast allows you to easily set your vertical rhythm, change properties over different media queries, play with font feature settings — everything you could imagine doing with web type can be done in the app.</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://www.typecast.com">Typecast</a> or free with a <a href="https://www.fonts.com">fonts.com</a> account</p>

<hr><h3>The Great Discontent, Issue One ($30)</h3>

<p><figure><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8581/15227790624_2522fa427e_o.jpg"/><figcaption>Weighing in at an impressive 272 pages on high quality paper, it&#8217;s the perfect desk companion for a healthy dose of inspiration</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>I have been a fan of Ryan and Tina Essmaker&#8217;s The Great Discontent for quite some time now — in fact, it has been my go-to example of responsive web design when I&#8217;m explaining it to clients. The inspiring interviews from the series come to life in high quality print with design and art direction from Frank Chimero.</p>
