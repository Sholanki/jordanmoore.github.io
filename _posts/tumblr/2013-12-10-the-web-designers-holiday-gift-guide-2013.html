<p>Now for something a little different. With Christmas around the corner I thought I’d share a collection of great gift ideas for your fellow web designer.</p>

<hr><h3><span>Pencil</span> from $49.95</h3>

<p>Fifty Three are best known for their impeccably designed and critically acclaimed Paper app for iPad. Now Paper has a hardware companion — Pencil. The milled, graphite brushed aluminium finish provides a good grip that compliments the carpenter pencil form and the eraser on the opposite end of the point does exactly as you’d expect in the app.</p>

<hr><h3><span>Slate</span> from $98</h3>

<p>This is a really neat idea. Slate is a portable desk that houses your laptop and a mobile device on your lap whilst providing you with space to take notes or even use a mouse. The holes beneath the space for your laptop helps keep your legs and your computer cool.</p>

<hr><h3><span>Device Lab stand</span> $149</h3>

<p>A must for the responsive web designer. This device stand from Vanamco houses up to 6 devices leaving a gutter for USB and charging cables.</p>

<hr><h3><span>UINK.it Stamp</span> from $35</h3>

<p>Sketches are an interface designer’s best friend. They’re quick and easy to produce — devices however are not. When producing mobile UIs it helps to frame them but this takes away a lot of the flow and spontaneity that sketching brings. UINK.it solves that allowing you to stamp device templates anywhere you want.</p>

<p>Gridbooks produce high quality notebooks for wireframing. Their Web Book features a 15-point dot grid that divides vertically into two, three, four, five and six columns with horizontal grids that can adapt to two, three, four, six, eight, twelve and sixteen columns.

<hr><h3><span>Cloud Typography subscription</span> $99</h3>

<p>The quality of Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones’ typefaces speak for themselves. Their long awaited web fonts service arrived earlier this year and the time taken to port their elegant library for the web shows in their ScreenSmart fonts. With packages starting from $99 per year it’s easy on the wallet too.</p>
