<p>The Chrome development team <a href="https://twitter.com/chromiumdev/status/401411675149975552">proudly announced</a> that they addressed one of the most common complaints from responsive designers about their browser - Chrome now let&#8217;s you resize your browser down to 320 pixels wide<sup id="fnref:p67088218748-1"><a href="#fn:p67088218748-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s nice to resize down to the width of some <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanmoore/status/398112918237376512">popular mobile device screen widths</a> it reminded me of some of the issues with relying on resizing a browser to test responsive designs.</p>

<p>Limitations with testing in a desktop browser:</p>

<ul><li>Not all devices have screens that are 320 pixels wide and larger</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t account for different pixel densities</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t touch it (well, you can but it won&#8217;t react)</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t reliably re-create touch-based gestures</li>
<li>Not every mobile browser runs on the same browser your are testing with</li>
<li>Not every layout problem you fix in a desktop browser is guaranteed to fix a layout problem on a real device</li>
<li>An unobscured desktop display gives an unrealistic impression of how your hand might grip a mobile device and obscure parts of the design</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t account for external factors like the shape and form of the device</li>
<li>A mouse pointer is more accurate than a finger</li>
<li>A desktop can&#8217;t account for the variance in mobile network speeds (you can fake a constant state but not the variance)</li>
<li>A desktop is hard to test in potential mobile contexts (in the sun, in the shade, in noisy environments, in quiet environments etc)</li>
<li>Proprietary software functions (like pinch to zoom) can&#8217;t be reliably emulated in desktop browsers</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t account for other operating system factors like the <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/tinytype">limited system fonts on Android devices</a></li>
</ul><p>There are more reasons, these are just the ones that spring to mind first. I&#8217;m not saying you should stay away from desktop browsers altogether for responsive design testing, in fact I find a narrow browser window a great foundation for making a start on responsive layouts — it&#8217;s part of my workflow.</p>

<p>Generally I find that using a desktop browser is good for quick layout tests — for example if something is badly broken it might be quickest to diagnose on a desktop browser, fix and test on real devices. It&#8217;s quick, it allows for page source inspection — it would be foolish not to make use of these tools.</p>

<p>The point I&#8217;m making is that there are testing limitations that you wouldn&#8217;t face with a suite of real devices<sup id="fnref:p67088218748-2"><a href="#fn:p67088218748-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
