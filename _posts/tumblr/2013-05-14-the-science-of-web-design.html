summary: I have a brief observation to make about the already saturated conversation of Photoshop vs designing in the browser. Flat compositions and designing with code are part of the same philosophy of web design, you just need to be mindful of how you use them.

<p>I have a brief observation to make about the already saturated conversation of Photoshop vs designing in the browser. Flat compositions and designing with code are part of the same philosophy of web design, you just need to be mindful of how you use them.</p>

<p>Wireframes, assets and flat compositions are the <em>theory</em> in the science of web design. You can quickly draft wireframes, produce visual assets as smaller, more robust theories whereas complete flat compositions are a larger, riskier theory — an attempt at finding a theory of everything.</p>

<p>Code on the other hand is where the real <em>science</em> happens. Using our elements, we can design with what we know to be true and work with facts rather than theories. We can use this science as a way of designing with real materials instead of asking our clients to sign off on a theory of a design that we are then contractually obliged to try and recreate with science.</p>

<p>The theory part is still necessary — it can help inform the scientific part during the build when the theory itself is based upon evidence and scientific fact. In other words, the more you familiarise yourself with code, the better you can theorise how things work on the web and the quicker the overall design process becomes.</p>

<p>Just like science you will know what experiments will work and what experiments will fail. When it is necessary to conceptualise things it makes more sense to do so in short bursts and test frequently with your scientific materials — your code.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#8217;t think there is a right or wrong design process. Some approaches simply take longer than others, but certain processes may be more comfortable for certain people. Your process is <strong>your</strong> process.</p>

<p>As the web has become a more diverse and unpredictable place I have learned that as with physics a web design theory of everything doesn&#8217;t exist yet — it may never exist. Even when we designed for the mythical fixed width web, our flat compositions didn&#8217;t <em>really</em> work. They were close but while elements like typography worked in theory they fell short in practice of the misleadingly optimal conditions of the boundless canvas of Photoshop. In more extreme cases we may have designed a component that looked beautiful in theory but simply couldn&#8217;t be recreated in code. It was always a misleading approach whether we designed for a fixed width or a responsive web.</p>

<p>There will always be a need for theories, although I feel we need to give up chasing rainbows for a unified theory of everything in web design. New design challenges will always arise where we need to produce new, smaller theories that are quicker to test and become fact. I find it works best when more elemental theories like design systems work together with the science of web design.</p>
