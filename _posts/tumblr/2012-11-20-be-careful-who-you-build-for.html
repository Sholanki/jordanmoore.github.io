summary: This hilarious animated gif crafted by Tiago Franco (<a href="http://twitter.com/Alarka">@Alarka</a>) has probably been viewed by the entire web development community by now. It shows the responsive web designer&#8217;s instinctive grabbing of the browser handles whenever they open a new website. We all do it and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.

<p>This hilarious animated gif crafted by Tiago Franco (<a href="http://twitter.com/Alarka">@Alarka</a>) has probably been viewed by the entire web development community by now. It shows the responsive web designer&#8217;s instinctive grabbing of the browser handles whenever they open a new website. We all do it and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>It illustrates a real problem in situations where web designers and developers <strong>try to design for this eventuality</strong> - to dazzle and amaze their industry colleagues while losing sight of the project&#8217;s audience. If you are building a website (responsive or otherwise) and your project personas become industry heroes rather than those you painstakingly identified at the beginning of a project then it&#8217;s time to worry. The project is in danger of losing sight of it&#8217;s <strong>original goals</strong>, the <strong>purpose</strong> it set out to serve and the <strong>value</strong> it was supposed to deliver. I would wager that this mostly happens around the concious incompetence and concious competence stages of <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/the_responsive_dip">the responsive dip</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong - I don&#8217;t have an issue with testing layouts in this manner for the right reasons, in fact I would strongly recommend <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/ish/">stress testing your layout</a> at <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/lab/responsiveroulette">random viewport widths</a>. Try closing your eyes whilst dragging the browser handles to alter the window width, stop dragging at a random point and then open your eyes again. This removes any transitional<sup id="fnref:p36129060691-1"><a href="#fn:p36129060691-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> hocus-pocus from the changing layout and gives you an idea of the state in which real users will load your product. Real users aren&#8217;t going to see changing layouts, the chances are they will see <strong>only one layout state</strong><sup id="fnref:p36129060691-2"><a href="#fn:p36129060691-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t lose sight of who you are really building this for.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanmoore/status/268649654005153792">speaking of transitions</a>, they are probably good indicators of the worst offenders. <a href="#fnref:p36129060691-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>Per browsing session, it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to assume a user may load your page on different devices at different times, in fact - almost a cert. Will they see the layout dynamically change between these sessions? No. Design for one state per session. <a href="#fnref:p36129060691-2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
