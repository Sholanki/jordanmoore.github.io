summary: Responsive web design has naturally moved us away from the world of the finite canvas of tools like Photoshop and on to the infinite canvas of the the web. Those I know that design and build responsive layouts no longer use Photoshop as the pixel perfect representation of the site yet to be built and have moved towards designing in the browser instead.

<p>As we adapt our code to adapt to changing contexts so must our process and therefore so must our tools.</p>

<p>Luke Wroblewski mentioned recently on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When trying to design in code, I inevitably need to bubble up to Photoshop every now &amp; then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(via <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lukew/status/170608365075042304">Luke W on Twitter</a>)</p>

<p>This made me think of my own process. Photoshop<sup id="fnref:p18085030035-1"><a href="#fn:p18085030035-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has become an add-on to the design and build process whereas before it was at the core of every design decision and central to the design process itself.</p>

<p>Responsive web design has naturally moved us away from the world of the finite canvas of tools like Photoshop and on to the infinite canvas of the the web. Those I know that design and build responsive layouts no longer use Photoshop as the pixel perfect representation of the site yet to be built and have moved towards designing in the browser instead. We now design in proportions, not pixels<sup id="fnref:p18085030035-2"><a href="#fn:p18085030035-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So what is the role of a graphics editor in a responsive designer&#8217;s toolkit? I can&#8217;t answer for everybody, and I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts, but for me the clue is in the name. <em>Photo</em>shop deals with raster graphics like photographs or textures that are otherwise unachievable natively in the browser. I find it ironic that responsive design has changed the role of my tools - they serve a different purpose now, they change, they respond.</p>
