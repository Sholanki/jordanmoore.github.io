summary: The web is inherently responsive. It&#8217;s in it&#8217;s DNA. If you create a structured HTML document with no CSS applied and open it in any browser, you will see it is naturally fluid and will fit any window size.

<p>The web is inherently responsive. It&#8217;s in it&#8217;s DNA. If you create a structured HTML document with no CSS applied and open it in any browser, you will see it is naturally fluid<sup id="fnref:p19444474810-1"><a href="#fn:p19444474810-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and will fit any window size.</p>

<p>This is why <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933" title="LukeW | Mobile First">mobile first</a> makes sense to me. Block level elements stack nicely on top of each other and are fluid by default so our code should&#8217;t be heavy at this stage. From a styling perspective, at the mobile first stage you are essentially adding colour, type properties and establishing the vertical relationship between objects.</p>

<p>At your breakpoints you are mainly dealing with layout (widths and floats). <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4227/" title="Adactio: Journal—Tweaking Huffduffer">Jeremy Keith&#8217;s approach</a> for serving stylesheets helps here. Jeremy serves a separate stylesheet for mobile which filters through all properties to the layout stylesheet which is only applied when a viewport can handle it. The layout stylesheet shouldn&#8217;t be heavy either as it should only contain layout properties.</p>

<p>Realising that the web is naturally responsive encourages your thinking to keep your code light. A lot of the work is already done for you when using a mobile first approach. That was my epiphany, I hope it helps you too.</p>
