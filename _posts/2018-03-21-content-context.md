Without content you are just making shapes on a screen. Decoration for decoration’s sake. A design without content is, at best, a guess. It’s a guess at how it should look and how it should feel.

Content is rooted in purpose and valuable context which informs design and therefore the overall shape of a product. Preconceived notions of how a product might look must be ignored and trust placed in the content to lead the decision making.

To begin decorating without knowing exactly what you are decorating for is the equivalent of putting the cart before the horse. Content is an absolute which is where value resides.
