I am delighted to announce that after 7 years working in web agencies I have decided to leave and start a new adventure as a freelance web designer.

I have spent the last 7 years honing my craft specialising in **responsive web design**, **user experience** as well as **front end** and **Expression Engine development**. I believe that working for both Front/Typecast and Eyekiller has equipped me with the skills required to manage my own destiny and seek new and exciting projects. 

Working and collaborating closely with clients of all different shapes and sizes from various sectors including the BBC, Firefly and TextHelp and has been a truly invaluable experience. The sum of the knowledge that I have gained along the way 

My last day at Eyekiller is just under a month away on April 1st 2015. If you have any projects you would like to discuss with me, please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:madebyjordan@gmail.com).
