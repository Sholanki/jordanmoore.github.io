summary: A silly little tool to help you clean crap off your screen without switching off or logging out. Makes use of the fullscreen API for big screens and just rotate to clean small screens.

[Wipe Screen](http://jordanm.co.uk/wipescreen) attempts to solve the following problems:

- Cleaning a dirty display
- Keeping the device switched on without having to log out and log back in again
- Keeping you in flow

It's a fullscreen black screen app designed to show up dirt. Grab a screen wipe and wipe your laptop screen or your touch device.

Touch support is patchy for now as the fullscreen API isn't reliable on smaller displays. Rotating your iOS device will have the same effect for the meantime.

Next steps:

- Turn into a bookmarklet rather than a bookmark
- Offer white alternative colour for stubborn stains
