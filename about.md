# Design <span>Philosophy</span>

Technique is learned but the ethos which you apply to your work cannot be learned nor forgottten, it’s something that realises itself over time.

I built my first web page in 1999. It was a page dedicated to my love of skateboarding. Many of the graphics were produced with the spraycan tool in MS Paint and the page itself was an export from Microsoft Frontpage and hosted on GeoCities. I had no idea that this new hobby was something I was going to dedicate the majority of my life to.

Over the last 16 years I have developed a philosophy which has delivered successful projects for the BBC, TextHelp, Firefly and I had a hand in creating Typecast, a tool for helping web designers design with web typography. Here’s a brief overview…

## Make useful things

For a product to deliver any real value for people, it needs to fulfil a need. It needs to solve a problem, it needs to be useful.


## Make visionary things

I strongly believe a product should be visionary. Something different. This process involves discussing with the project team the vision for the product, what could it achieve without obstruction?


## Make accessible things

In web design speak, accessibility is often the label for something that works for people who need assistance browsing the web. I feel that acessibility should be a given, not a feature. For me being accessible means it’s for **everyone** regardless of ability, geographical location, device, hardware and software.


## Make sustainable things

Sustainability is as crucial to the user’s experience as it is to the eventual product owner. A sustainable product doesn’t collapse when I leave the project. A sustainable product lives and thrives over time and it doesn’t degrade with the introduction of new technology.
